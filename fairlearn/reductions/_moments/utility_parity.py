class UtilityParity(ClassificationMoment):
    r"""A generic moment for parity in utilities (or costs) under classification.

    This serves as the base class for :class:`DemographicParity`,
    :class:`EqualizedOdds`, and others. All subclasses can be used as
    difference-based constraints or ratio-based constraints.
    Refer to the :ref:`user guide <constraints_binary_classification>` for
    more information and example usage.

    Constraints compare the group-level mean utility for each group with the
    overall mean utility (unless further events are specified, e.g., in
    equalized odds).
    Constraint violation for difference-based constraints starts if the
    difference between a group and the overall population with regard to a
    utility exceeds `difference_bound`. For ratio-based constraints, the ratio
    between the group-level and overall mean utility needs to be bounded
    between `ratio_bound` and its inverse (plus an additional additive
    `ratio_bound_slack`).

    The `index` field is a :class:`pandas:pandas.MultiIndex` corresponding to
    the constraint IDs.
    It is an index of various DataFrame and Series objects that are either
    required as arguments or returned by several of the methods of the
    `UtilityParity` class. It is the Cartesian product of:

    - The unique events defining the particular moment object
    - The unique values of the sensitive feature
    - The characters `+` and `-`, corresponding to the Lagrange multipliers
      for positive and negative violations of the constraint

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <constraints_binary_classification>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    difference_bound : float

        as differences, also referred to as :math:`\\epsilon` in documentation.

        If neither `ratio_bound` nor `difference_bound` are set then a default
        difference bound of 0.01 is used for backwards compatibility.
        Default None.
    ratio_bound : float
        The constraints' ratio bound for constraints that are expressed as
        ratios. The specified value needs to be in (0,1].
        If `difference_bound` is used then `ratio_bound` needs to be None.
        Default None.
    ratio_bound_slack : float
        The constraints' ratio bound slack for constraints that are
        expressed as ratios, also referred to as :math:`\\epsilon` in
        documentation.
        `ratio_bound_slack` is ignored if `ratio_bound` is not specified.
