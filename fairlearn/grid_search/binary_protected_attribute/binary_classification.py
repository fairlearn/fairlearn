    optimisation problem (the constraint being demographic parity), each
    one corresponding to a particular tradeoff between fairness and
    accuracy

    :param learner: An object which can be used to fit a model to
    features, labels and weights. A deep copy of this is made for each
    value of the lagrange multiplier used
    :type learner: Must implement a fit(x, y, sample_weight) method

    not contain the protected attribute). Must have as many rows
    as y and protected_attribute
    :type x: Nested list or numpy array with two dimensions or
    pandas dataframe

    :param y: The list of binary classes, which must be 0 or 1. Must
    contain the same number of entries as rows in x. We do not
    consider it an error if only one class is present

    multipliers to use for the optimisation problem. If this is set

    :param number_lagrange_multipliers: Specifies the number of
    Lagrange multipliers to use in the optimisation problem. If this
    is set then lagrange_multipliers must be None.
    The result array will have as many entries as specified here

    multiplier tested

    "lagrange_multiplier" and "model." Each model will correspond to
    the input parameter learner after calling 'fit' on it (a deep
    copy is made). The user is responsible for converting these
    objects to an actual model, if further processing is required.
