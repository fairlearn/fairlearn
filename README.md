# Fairness in Machine Learning - Mitigation algorithms

A Python package that implements a variety of fairness-related algorithms to mitigate bias including:

| algorithm | description | classification/regression | protected attributes | supported fairness definitions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fairlearn.` `expgrad` | Black-box approach to fair classification described in the paper [A Reductions Approach to Fair Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02453)| binary classification | categorical | DP, EO |
| `fairlearn.` `reductions.` `GridSearch` | As described in Section 3.4 in the paper [A Reductions Approach to Fair Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02453)| binary classification | binary | DP |
| `fairlearn.` `reductions.` `GridSearch` | Grid Search for regression | regression | binary | BGL |
| `fairlearn.` `post_processing.` `ThresholdOptimizer` | Post-processing algorithm based on the paper [Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02413.pdf)| binary classification | categorical | DP, EO |

DP refers to Demographic Parity, EO to Equalized Odds, and BGL to Bounded Group Loss. For more information on these and other terms we use in this repository please refer to [the Terminology page](TERMINOLOGY.md).

</summary>

As of version 0.2 fairlearn contained only the exponentiated gradient method. The fairlearn repository now has a much more comprehensive approach to fairness and aims to incorporate other methods as specified above. The same exponentiated gradient technique is now located under `fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient` as a class. While in the past one could have run

```python
import numpy as np
from fairlearn.classred import expgrad
from fairlearn.moments import DP

estimator = LogisticRegression()  # or any other estimator
exponentiated_gradient_result = expgrad(X, group_data, y, estimator, constraints=DP())
positive_probabilities = exponentiated_gradient_result.best_classifier(X)
randomized_predictions = (positive_probabilities >= np.random.rand(len(positive_probabilities))) * 1
```

the equivalent operation is now

```python
from fairlearn.reductions import ExponentiatedGradient
from fairlearn.reductions.moments import DemographicParity

estimator = LogisticRegression()  # or any other estimator
constraints = DemographicParity()
exponentiated_gradient = ExponentiatedGradient(estimator, constraints=constraints)
exponentiated_gradient.fit(X, y, group_data)
randomized_predictions = exponentiated_gradient.predict(X)
```

Please reach out through the "Issues" if you encounter any problems.
