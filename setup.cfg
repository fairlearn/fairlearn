# Suppress particular flake8 warnings
# Ideally for the fairlearn directory (which becomes the published wheel) we would have no
# suppressions. For the following reasons, we still have some remaining:
# D100 requires docstrings on public modules but there is some issue with '_' prefixes on filenames
# D107 requires docstrings on __init__ but these are ignored in our current sphinx configuration
# RST304 is about "unknown text roles" in sphinx. Unfortunately, things like :class: appear to be unknown
# RST902 is from trouble parsing the __all__ entry. This only happens in a single file
