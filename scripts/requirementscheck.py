"""Simple script for comparing two requirements files.

Given two requirements files, this script:
- Checks that they both contain the same list of packages
- Checks that the package versions match according to the following
  rules:
    - If no version is specified for one, it must not be specified
      for the other
    - If a version is specified, then the only valid comparators are
      '==' and '>='
    - If a version is specified in one file, then the same version
      must be specified in the other
The purposes of these comparisons is to ensure that our
`requirements.txt` and `requirements-fixed.txt` files are kept in
sync.

If any of the checks fail, then the script will write out information
about the failures (preprended for highlighting as an error in Azure
Dev Ops) and return 1 instead of 0.

At present there is no support for parsing `setup.py` and checking
the packages listed there.
