Performing a Fairness Assessment
================================

.. currentmodule:: fairlearn.metrics

The goal of fairness assessment is to answer the question: Which groups of 
people may be disproportionately negatively impacted by an AI system and in 
what ways?

The steps of the assessment are as follows:

1. Identify types of harms 
2. Identify the groups that might be harmed 
3. Quantify harms 
4. Compare quantified harms across the groups 

We next examine these four steps in more detail.

Identify types of harms
-----------------------

See :ref:`types_of_harms` for a guide to types of fairness-related harms.
The Fairlearn package is particularly suitable for measuring:

* *Allocation Harms* occur when a system unfairly extends or witholds
  opportunities, resources, or information.
  Common (but by no means exhaustive) examples are hiring for jobs, student
  admissions and loan origination.

* *Quality of Service Harms* occur when a system works much better for
  one group than another.
  For example, facial recognition and speech-to-text systems may have
  substantially different performance for different ethnicities.

Note that one system can lead to multiple harms, and different types of 
harms are not mutually exclusive.
For more information, review Fairlearn's
`2021 SciPy tutorial <https://github.com/fairlearn/talks/blob/main/2021_scipy_tutorial/overview.pdf>`_.

Identify the groups that might be harmed
----------------------------------------

In most applications, we consider demographic groups including historically 
marginalized groups (e.g., based on gender, race, ethnicity). We should also 
consider groups that are relevant to a particular use case or deployment context. For example, for 
speech-to-text transcription, this might include groups who speak a regional dialect or people who are a  
native or a non-native speaker.

It is also important to consider group intersections, for example, in addition
to considering groups according to gender and groups according to race, it is 
also important to consider their intersections (e.g., Black women, Latinx 
nonbinary people, etc.). :footcite:cts:`crenshaw1991intersectionality`
offers a thorough background on the topic of intersectionality.
See :ref:`this section <assessment_intersecting_groups>` of our user guide for
details of how Fairlearn can compute metrics for intersections.


.. note::

    We have assumed that every sensitive feature is representable by a
    discrete variable.
    This is not always the case: for example, the melanin content of a
    person's skin (important for tasks such as facial recognition) will
    not be taken from a small number of fixed values.
    Features like this have to be binned, and the choice of bins
    could obscure fairness issues.

.. _assessment_quantify_harms:

Quantify harms
--------------

Define metrics that quantify harms or benefits:

* In a job screening scenario, we need to quantify the number of candidates
  that are classified as "negative" (not recommended for the job), but whose
  true label is "positive" (they are "qualified"). One possible metric is
  the false negative rate: fraction of qualified candidates that are
  screened out. Note that before we attempt to classify candidates, we need
  to determine the construct validity of the "qualified" status; more
  information on construct validity can be found in :ref:`construct_validity`

* For a speech-to-text application, the harm could be measured by disparities
  in the word error rate for different group, measured by the number of
  mistakes in a transcript divided by the overall number of words.

Note that in some cases, the outcome we seek to measure is not 
directly available. 
Occasionally, another variable in our dataset provides a close 
approximation to the phenomenon we seek to measure. 
In these cases, we might choose to use that closely related variable, 
often called a "proxy", to stand in for the missing variable. 
For example, suppose that in the job screening scenario, 
we have data on whether the candidate passes the first two stages, 
but not if they are ultimately recommended for the job. 

As an alternative to the unobserved final recommendation, we could
therefore measure the harm using the proxy variable indicating whether
the candidate passes the first stage of the screen.
If you choose to use a proxy variable to 
represent the harm, check the proxy variable regularly to ensure it 
remains useful over time. Our section on
:ref:`construct validity <construct_validity>`
describes how to determine whether a  
proxy variable measures the intended construct in a meaningful 
and useful way. It is important to ensure that the proxy is suitable 
for the social context of the problem you seek to solve. 
In particular, be careful of falling into one of the
:ref:`abstraction traps <abstraction_traps>`.


.. _assessment_disaggregated_metrics:

Disaggregated metrics
---------------------

The centerpiece of fairness assessment in Fairlearn are disaggregated metrics, 
which are metrics evaluated on slices of data.
For example, to measure gender-based harms due to errors, we would begin by
evaluating the errors separately for males, females and nonbinary persons
in our dataset.
If we found that males were experiencing errors at a much lower rate than
females and nonbinary persons, we would flag this as a potential fairness harm.

Note that by "errors" here, we are referring to the methods we use to 
assess the performance of the machine learning model overall, for 
example accuracy or precision in the classification case. 
We distiniguish these model performance metrics from fairness metrics, 
which operationalize different definitions of fairness 
(such as demographic parity or equal opportunity).
We will review those metrics in a subsequent section of the User Guide. 
For more information on fairness metrics, 
review :ref:`common_fairness_metrics`.

Fairlearn provides the :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` class to help
with this quantification.
Suppose we have some 'true' values, some predictions from a model, and also
a sensitive feature recorded for each.
The sensitive feature, denoted by :code:`sf_data`, can take on one of
three values:

.. doctest:: assessment_metrics

    >>> y_true = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    >>> y_pred = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
    >>> sf_data = ['b', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a',
    ...            'a', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'b', 'c', 'c']


Now, suppose we have determined that the metrics we are interested in are the
selection rate (:func:`selection_rate`), recall (a.k.a. true positive rate
:func:`sklearn.metrics.recall_score`) and false positive rate
(:func:`false_positive_rate`).
For completeness (and to help identify subgroups for which random noise might be
significant), we should also include the counts (:func:`count`).
We can use :class:`MetricFrame` to evaluate these metrics on our data:

.. doctest:: assessment_metrics
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 20)
    >>> pd.set_option('display.width', 80)
    >>> from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame
    >>> from fairlearn.metrics import count, \
    ...                               false_positive_rate, \
    ...                               selection_rate
    >>> from sklearn.metrics import recall_score
    >>> # Construct a function dictionary
    >>> my_metrics = {
    ...     'tpr' : recall_score,
    ...     'fpr' : false_positive_rate,
    ...     'sel' : selection_rate,
    ...     'count' : count
    ... }
    >>> # Construct a MetricFrame
    >>> mf = MetricFrame(
    ...     metrics=my_metrics,
    ...     y_true=y_true,
    ...     y_pred=y_pred,
    ...     sensitive_features=sf_data
    ... )

We can now interrogate this :class:`MetricFrame` to find the values for
our chosen metrics.
First, the metrics evaluated on the entire dataset (disregarding the
sensitive feature), accessed via the :attr:`MetricFrame.overall`
property:

.. doctest:: assessment_metrics
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> mf.overall
    tpr       0.500000
    fpr       0.666667
    sel       0.555556
    count    18.000000
    dtype: float64

Next, we can see the metrics evaluated on each of the groups identified by
the :code:`sf_data` column.
These are accessed through the :attr:`MetricFrame.by_group` property:

.. doctest:: assessment_metrics
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> mf.by_group
                         tpr       fpr   sel  count
    sensitive_feature_0
    a                    0.5  1.000000  0.75    4.0
    b                    0.6  0.000000  0.50    6.0
    c                    0.4  0.666667  0.50    8.0

All of these values can be checked against the original arrays above.

.. note::

  Note that :class:`MetricFrame` is intended for analyzing the disparities 
  between groups with regard to a base metric, and consequently cannot take 
  predefined fairness metrics, such as :func:`demographic_parity_difference`, 
  as input to the `metrics` parameter.

.. _assessment_compare_harms:

Compare quantified harms across the groups
------------------------------------------

To summarize the disparities in errors (or other metrics), we may want to 
report quantities such as the difference or ratio of the metric values between 
the best and the worst groups identified by the sensitive feature(s).
In settings where the goal is to guarantee certain minimum quality of service
across all groups (such as speech recognition), it is also meaningful to
report the worst performance across all considered groups.

The :class:`MetricFrame` class provides several methods for comparing
the computed metrics.
For example, the :meth:`MetricFrame.group_min` and :meth:`MetricFrame.group_max`
methods show the smallest and largest values for each metric:

.. doctest:: assessment_metrics
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> mf.group_min()
    tpr      0.4
    fpr      0.0
    sel      0.5
    count    4.0
    dtype: object
    >>> mf.group_max()
    tpr       0.6
    fpr       1.0
    sel      0.75
    count     8.0
    dtype: object

We can also compute differences and ratios between groups for all of the
metrics.
These are available via the :meth:`MetricFrame.difference` and
:meth:`MetricFrame.ratio` methods respectively.
The absolute difference will always be returned, and the ratios will be chosen
to be less than one.
By default, the computations are done between the maximum and minimum
values for the groups:

.. doctest:: assessment_metrics
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> mf.difference()
    tpr      0.20
    fpr      1.00
    sel      0.25
    count    4.00
    dtype: float64
    >>> mf.ratio()
    tpr      0.666667
    fpr      0.000000
    sel      0.666667
    count    0.500000
    dtype: float64

However, the differences and ratios can also be computed relative to the
overall values for the data:

.. doctest:: assessment_metrics
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> mf.difference(method='to_overall')
    tpr       0.100000
    fpr       0.666667
    sel       0.194444
    count    14.000000
    dtype: float64
    >>> mf.ratio(method='to_overall')
    tpr      0.800000
    fpr      0.000000
    sel      0.740741
    count    0.222222
    dtype: float64

In every case, the *largest* difference and *smallest* ratio are returned.


.. _assessment_predefined_fairness_metrics:

Predefined fairness metrics
---------------------------

In addition to the disaggregated analysis of base metrics enabled by
:class:`MetricFrame`, Fairlearn also provides a set of predefined fairness 
metrics that output a single score. These metrics take as input 
`sensitive_features` to compute the maximum difference or ratio between 
subgroups of a sensitive variable. The predefined fairness metrics offered 
by Fairlearn are :func:`demographic_parity_difference`, 
:func:`demographic_parity_ratio`, :func:`equalized_odds_difference`, 
and :func:`equalized_odds_ratio`. 
The ratio and difference can be calculated `between_groups` 
or `to_overall`, but `to_overall` results in more than 1 value being 
returned (when the `control_features` parameter is not `None`.
:class:`MetricFrame` can also calculate differences and ratios between 
groups. For more information on available method of computing 
ratios or differences, view the documentation for :meth:`MetricFrame.ratio` 
and :meth:`MetricFrame.difference`, respectively.
Note that because these metrics are calculated using 
aggregations between groups, they are meant to be 
called directly, rather than used within the instantiation of a MetricFrame.

Below, we show an example of calculating demographic parity ratio using the 
sample data defined above.

.. doctest:: assessment_metrics
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> from fairlearn.metrics import demographic_parity_ratio
    >>> print(demographic_parity_ratio(y_true,
    ...                                y_pred,
    ...                                sensitive_features=sf_data))
    0.66666...

It is also possible to define custom fairness metrics based on any 
standard performance metric (e.g., the false positive rate or AUC) 
using :func:make_derived_metric. 
Under the hood, the fairness assessment metrics 
also use :class:`MetricFrame` to compute a particular base rate across 
sensitive groups and subsequently perform an aggregation (the difference 
or ratio) on the base metric values across groups. For example, 
:func:`equalized_odds_ratio` uses both the :func:`false_positive_rate` and
:func:`false_negative_rate` within a :class:`MetricFrame` on the backend 
to generate an output. As demonstrated below, 
using :func:`equalized_odds_ratio` and :meth:`MetricFrame.ratio` method 
produces the same outcome. 

.. doctest:: assessment_metrics
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> from fairlearn.metrics import equalized_odds_ratio
    >>> print(equalized_odds_ratio(y_true,
    ...                                y_pred,
    ...                                sensitive_features=sf_data))
    0.0
    >>> my_metrics = {
    ...     'tpr' : recall_score,
    ...     'fpr' : false_positive_rate
    ... }
    >>> mf = MetricFrame(
    ...     metrics=my_metrics,
    ...     y_true=y_true,
    ...     y_pred=y_pred,
    ...     sensitive_features=sf_data
    ... )
    >>> min(mf.ratio(method="between_groups"))
    0.0
