Further Reading
===============

There are a number of sources of further information about fairness in machine learning.
Here we list which concentrate more on the broader societal impact of machine learning,
rather than technical details of algorithms.

The following books provide excellent overviews of the various ways in which machine
learning algorithms can have harmful effects:

- `Weapons of Math Destruction <https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/>`_ by Cathy O'Neill
- `Artificial Unintelligence <https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/artificial-unintelligence>`_ by Meredith Broussard
- `Algorithms of Oppression <https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/>`_ by Safiya Umoja Noble

There are also papers which focus less on individual algorithms, and more on societal impacts.
A selection of these follows:

- `Big Data's Disparate Impact <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2477899##>`_ (Barocas & Selbst, 2016)
- `Measures and Mismeasures of Fairness <https://5harad.com/papers/fair-ml.pdf>`_ (Corbett-Davies & Goel, 2018)
- `Fairness and Abstraction in Sociotechnical Systems <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3265913>`_ (Selbst et al., 2018)
- `A Survey on Bias and Fairness in Machine Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09635>`_ (Mehrabi et al. 2019)
- `Algorithmic Fairness from a Non-ideal Perspective <http://zacklipton.com/media/papers/fairness-non-ideal-fazelpour-lipton-2020.pdf>`_ (Fazelpour & Lipton, 2020)
