Diabetes 130-Hospitals Dataset
------------------------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Diabetes 130-Hospitals Dataset consists of 10 years worth of clinical care data
at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks :footcite:`strack2014impact`.
Each record represents the hospital admission record for a patient diagnosed with
diabetes whose stay lasted between one to fourteen days. Also, laboratory tests were
performed and medications were administered during the encounter. The features
describing each encounter include demographics, diagnoses, diabetic medications, number
of visits in the year preceding  the encounter, and payer information, as well as
whether the patient was readmitted after release, and whether the readmission occurred
within 30 days of the release.

Strack et al. used the data to investigate the impact of HbA1c measurement
on hospital readmission rates. The data was collected from the Health Facts
database, which is a national data warehouse in the United States consisting of
clinical records from hospitals throughout the United States. Once Strack et al.
completed their research, the dataset was submitted to the UCI Machine Learning
Repository such that it became available for later use.

Dataset Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The original data can be found in the UCI Repository :footcite:`strack2014diabetes`.
This version of the dataset was derived by the Fairlearn team for the SciPy 2021
tutorial "Fairness in AI Systems: From social context to practice using Fairlearn".
In this version, the target variable "readmitted" is binarized into whether the
patient was readmitted within thirty days. The full dataset pre-processing script
can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/fairlearn/talks/blob/main/2021_scipy_tutorial/preprocess.py>`_.
The dataset contains 101,766 rows. Each row describes a patient encounter and
contains 25 features, which we describe below:
