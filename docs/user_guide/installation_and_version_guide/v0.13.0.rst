v0.13.0
=======

Summary
-------

This release introduces a new method implementation, :code:`PrototypeRepresentationLearner`,
which is based on the work of Zemel et al. (2013) :footcite:`pmlr-v28-zemel13`.
You can learn more about it :ref:`here <prototype_representation_learner>`.

Additionally, this release includes several improvements to existing
functionality: enhanced support for relaxed constraints and multi-dimensional
input data in optimization methods, performance improvements through
vectorization, updating the supported Python versions (removed 3.8, added 3.12),
first efforts concerning Narwhals integration, removal of unused functionality,
and cleanup of local logging initialization.


New methods
-----------

* Implemented the :code:`PrototypeRepresentationLearner`  introduced in Zemel et al. (2013) :footcite:`pmlr-v28-zemel13`:
  :pr:`1478` by :user:`Tahar Allouche <taharallouche>`.

New features
------------

* Allowed relaxed constraints (except :code:`equalized_odds`) in :code:`ThresholdOptimizer`: :pr:`1453` by :user:`Tahar Allouche <taharallouche>`
* Allowed multi-dimensional input data :code:`X` (:code:`ndims > 2`) in :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` and :code:`ExponentiatedGradient`: :pr:`1470` by :user:`Tahar Allouche <taharallouche>`.

Performance improvements
------------------------

* Vectorized the curve interpolation step in :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` to improve performance and readability: :pr:`1448` by :user:`Tahar Allouche <taharallouche>`.

Narwhals integration
--------------------

* Make `preprocessing` module dataframe agnostic through Narwhals: :pr:`1525` by :user:`Francesco Bruzzesi <FBruzzesi>`.
* Make :code:`AnnotatedMetricFunction` class dataframe agnostic through Narwhals: :pr:`1545` by :user:`Francesco Bruzzesi <FBruzzesi>`.

Other improvements
------------------

* Removed support for python 3.8 and added support for python 3.12: :pr:`1488` by :user:`Tamara Atanasoska <tamaraatanasoska>`.
* Removed the keyword argument `control_features` from :code:`ErrorRate.load_data`, since it was without functionality for the method: :pr:`1531` by :user:`Stefanie Senger <StefanieSenger>`.
* Removed local logging using environment variable `FAIRLEARN_LOGS` at initialization: :pr:`1561` by :user:`Parul Gupta <parulgupta1004>`.
