v0.6.0
======

* Add `CorrelationRemover` preprocessing technique. This removes correlations
  between sensitive and non-sensitive features while retaining as much information
  as possible
* Add `control_features` to the classification moments. These allow for data
  stratification, with fairness constraints enforced within each stratum, but
  not between strata
* Update `make_derived_metric()` to use `MetricFrame`
* Assorted small documentation fixes
