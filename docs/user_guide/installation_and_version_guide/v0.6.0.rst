v0.6.0
======

* Add :class:`fairlearn.preprocessing.CorrelationRemover` preprocessing
  technique. This removes correlations between sensitive and non-sensitive
  features while retaining as much information as possible.
* Add :code:`control_features` to the classification moments. These allow for
  data stratification, with fairness constraints enforced within each stratum,
  but not between strata.
* Update :code:`make_derived_metric()` to use
  :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame`
* Assorted small documentation fixes
