v0.7.0
======

* Added new :func:`~fairlearn.metrics.count` metric, so that the number of
  data points in each group is noted when using
  :class:`~fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame`.
* Changed :class:`~fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` constructor API.
  The :code:`metric` argument is now :code:`metrics` and all positional
  arguments are now keyword arguments. The previous call format still works
  (until v0.10.0), but issues a deprecation warning.
* :class:`fairlearn.postprocessing.ThresholdOptimizer` now accepts
  :code:`predict_method` as a parameter which allows users to define which
  estimator method should be used to get the prediction values:
  :code:`"predict_proba"` and :code:`"decision_function"` for
  soft values and :code:`"predict"` for hard values from classifiers.
* Removed :code:`fairlearn.widgets` module including the
  :code:`FairlearnDashboard`.
  Instead, the :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` supports plotting as
  explained in :ref:`plot`.
* Added return value (:code:`self`) to
  :class:`fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient`'s :code:`fit` method.
