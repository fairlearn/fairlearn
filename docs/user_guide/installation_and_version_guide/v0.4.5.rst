v0.4.5
======

* Changes to :class:`.ThresholdOptimizer`:

  * Separate plotting for :class:`.ThresholdOptimizer` into its own plotting
    function.
  * :class:`.ThresholdOptimizer` now performs validations during :code:`fit`,
    and not during :code:`__init__`. It also stores the fitted given estimator
    in the :code:`estimator_` attribute.
  * :class:`.ThresholdOptimizer` is now a scikit-learn meta-estimator, and
    accepts an estimator through the :code:`estimator` parameter. To use a
    pre-fitted estimator, pass :code:`prefit=True`.
* Made :code:`_create_group_metric_set_()` private by prepending with
  :code:`_`.
  Also changed the arguments, so that this routine requires
  dictionaries for the predictions and sensitive features. This is a
  breaking change.
* Remove :code:`Reduction` base class for reductions methods and replace it
  with :class:`sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` and
  :code:`MetaEstimatorMixin`.
* Remove :code:`ExponentiatedGradientResult` and :code:`GridSearchResult` in
  favor of storing the values and objects resulting from fitting the
  meta-estimator directly in the :class:`.ExponentiatedGradient` and
  :class:`.GridSearch` objects, respectively.
* Fix regression in input validation that dropped metadata from :code:`X` if
  it is provided as a :class:`pandas.DataFrame`.
