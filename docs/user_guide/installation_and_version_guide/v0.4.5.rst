v0.4.5
======

* Changes to `ThresholdOptimizer`:
  * Separate plotting for `ThresholdOptimizer` into its own plotting function.
  * `ThresholdOptimizer` now performs validations during `fit`, and not during
    `__init__`. It also stores the fitted given estimator in the `estimator_`
    attribute.
  * `ThresholdOptmizer` is now a scikit-learn meta-estimator, and accepts
    an estimator through the `estimator` parameter. To use a pre-fitted
    estimator, pass `prefit=True`.
* Made `_create_group_metric_set_()` private by prepending with `_`.
  Also changed the arguments, so that this routine requires
  dictionaries for the predictions and sensitive features. This is a
  breaking change.
* Remove `Reduction` base class for reductions methods and replace it with
  `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` and `sklearn.base.MetaEstimatorMixin`.
* Remove `ExponentiatedGradientResult` and `GridSearchResult` in favor of
  storing the values and objects resulting from fitting the meta-estimator
  directly in the `ExponentiatedGradient` and `GridSearch` objects,
  respectively.
* Fix regression in input validation that dropped metadata from `X` if it is
  provided as a `pandas.DataFrame`.
