v0.7.1
======

.. note::

  v0.7.1 is not yet released. This page reflects changes on the current
  :code:`main` branch that will eventually be a part of v0.7.1.

* Relaxed checks made on :code:`X` in :code:`_validate_and_reformat_input()`
  since that is the concern of the underlying estimator and not Fairlearn.
* Add support for Python 3.9
* Added error handling in :code:`MetricFrame`. Methods :code:`group_max`, :code:`group_min`,
  :code:`difference` and :code:`ratio` now accept :code:`errors` as a parameter,
  which could either be :code:`raise` or :code:`coerce`.
* Fixed a bug whereby passing a custom :code:`grid` object to a :code:`GridSearch`
  reduction would result in a :code:`KeyError` if the column names were not ordered
  integers.
* :class:`~fairlearn.preprocessing.CorrelationRemover` now exposes
  :code:`n_features_in_` and :code:`feature_names_in_`.
* Added the ACSIncome dataset and corresponding documentation.
* Added :class:`~fairlearn.postprocessing.Thresholder`, including the corresponding
  documentation and a user guide.
* Added :func:`~fairlearn.postprocessing.plot_histograms_per_group`, :func:`~fairlearn.postprocessing.plot_positive_predictions`,
  :func:`~fairlearn.postprocessing.plot_proba_distribution` to :code:`fairlearn.postprocessing`.
