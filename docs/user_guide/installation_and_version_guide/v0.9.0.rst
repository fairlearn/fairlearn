v0.9.0
======

* Added Credit Loan Decisions example notebook.
* Bugfix for :code:`~fairlearn.metrics.selection_rate` to handle :code:`TypeError` when input is
  scalar.
* Added support for pickling classes in `fairlearn.reductions`.
* Bugfix for `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` in
  :code:`~fairlearn.adversarial._preprocesser.FloatTransformer` to ensure compatibility with
  scikit-learn 1.2.
* Set default value of :code:`parser` of `sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml` in
  :code:`~fairlearn.datasets` to :code:`liac-arff` to match behavior before scikit-learn 1.2.
* Replace calculations in :code:`~fairlearn.reductions._moments.UtilityParity` by matrix
  multiplication which can lead to substantial speed-ups for
  :code:`~fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient` for simple estimators like logistic
  regression.
* Added :code:`as_frame` (with default :code:`True`) argument to
  :code:`datasets._fetch_diabetes_hospital`.
* Changed :code:`as_frame` default to :code:`True` for all remaining datasets.
* Changed :code:`~fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame`` so that all results (including aggregations) are
  computed in the constructor and then cached.
* Bugfix for :code:`~fairlearn.adversarial` that changes the loss function `NLLLoss` to
  `CrossEntropyLoss`.
* Various documentation tweaks and enhancements, including restructuring of the user guide and
  breaking out information in the API reference to separate pages.
