v0.11.0
=======

.. note::

   v0.11.0 is not yet released. This page reflects changes on the current
   :code:`main` branch that will eventually be a part of v0.11.0.

* Added disparity metric :code:`equal_opportunity_{difference,ratio}` as a frequently used alias
  for :code:`true_positive_rate_{difference,ratio}`.

* Removed :code:`_AdversarialFairness.decision_function` because it did not follow the expected contract with
  :code:`_AdversarialFairness.predict`.
