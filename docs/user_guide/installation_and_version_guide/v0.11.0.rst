v0.11.0
=======

* Added disparity metric :code:`equal_opportunity_{difference,ratio}` as a frequently
  used alias for :code:`true_positive_rate_{difference,ratio}`.

* Removed :code:`_AdversarialFairness.decision_function` because it did not follow the
  expected contract with :code:`_AdversarialFairness.predict`.
