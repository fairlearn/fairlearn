v0.11.0
=======

This release greately improves upon the :code:`scikit-learn` compatibility of the
:code:`AdversarialFairnessClassifier` and :code:`AdversarialFairnessRegressor`
estimators. It also includes a number of other improvements.

:code:`scikit-learn` compatibility
--------------------------------

* The estimators :code:`AdversarialFairnessClassifier` and :code:`AdversarialFairnessRegressor`
  now pass all but one :code:`scikit-learn` estimator checks. Changes in
  `#1410 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1410>`_,
  `#1405 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1405>`_,
  `#1399 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1399>`_,
  `#1398 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1398>`_,
  `#1394 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1394>`_,
  `#1393 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1393>`_,
  `#1369 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1369>`_,
  and the ones included below in this section.

* Added :code:`classes_` attribute to :code:`AdversarialFairnessClassifier` and
  :code:`AdversarialFairnessRegressor` in `#1384 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1384>`_.

* Removed :code:`_AdversarialFairness.decision_function` because it did not follow the
  expected contract with :code:`_AdversarialFairness.predict` in
  `#1397 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1397>`_.



Other improvements
------------------

* Added disparity metric :code:`equal_opportunity_{difference,ratio}` as a frequently
  used alias for :code:`true_positive_rate_{difference,ratio}`.

* Added :code:`numpy` 2.0.0 compatibility in `#1387 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1387>`_.

* Fixed :code:`pandas` warnings in `#1363 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1363>`_ and
  `#1339 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1339>`_.

* Fixed output dimensions bug in :code:`FloatingPointTransformer` in
  `#1333 <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1333>`_.
