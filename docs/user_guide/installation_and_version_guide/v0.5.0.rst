v0.5.0
======

* Adjust classes to abide by naming conventions for attributes.

* Change :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient`'s signature by
  renaming argument :code:`T` to :code:`max_iter`, :code:`eta_mul` to
  :code:`eta0`, and by adding :code:`run_linprog_step`.

* API refactoring to separate out different uses of :code:`eps` within
  :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient`. It is now solely
  responsible for setting the L1 norm bound in the optimization (which
  controls the excess constraint violation beyond what is allowed by the
  :code:`constraints` object).
  The other usage of :code:`eps` as the right-hand side of constraints is
  now captured directly in the moment classes as follows:

  * Classification moments: :code:`ConditionalSelectionRate` renamed to
    :class:`fairlearn.reductions.UtilityParity` and its subclasses have new
    arguments on the constructor:

    * :code:`difference_bound` - for difference-based constraints such as
      demographic parity difference
    * :code:`ratio_bound_slack` - for ratio-based constraints such as
      demographic parity ratio
    * Additionally, there's a :code:`ratio_bound` argument which represents
      the argument previously called :code:`ratio`.

  * Regression moments: :code:`ConditionalLossMoment`
    and its subclasses have a new argument :code:`upper_bound` with the same
    purpose for newly enabled regression scenarios on
    :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient`.

  For a comprehensive overview of available constraints refer to the new
  :ref:`user guide on fairness constraints for reductions methods <reductions>`.

* Renamed several constraints to create a uniform naming convention according
  to the accepted
  `metric harmonization proposal <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn-proposals/blob/master/api/METRICS.md>`_:

  * :code:`ErrorRateRatio` renamed to
    :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.ErrorRateParity`, and
    :code:`TruePositiveRateDifference` renamed to
    :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.TruePositiveRateParity` since the
    desired pattern is :code:`<metric name>Parity` with the exception of
    :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.EqualizedOdds` and
    :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.DemographicParity`.
  * :code:`ConditionalSelectionRate` renamed to
    :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.UtilityParity`.
  * :code:`GroupLossMoment` renamed to
    :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.BoundedGroupLoss` in order to have a
    descriptive name and for consistency with the paper. Similarly,
    :code:`AverageLossMoment` renamed to
    :code:`MeanLoss`.

    For a comprehensive overview of available constraints refer to the new
    :ref:`user guide on fairness constraints for reductions methods <reductions>`.

* Added :code:`TrueNegativeRateParity` to provide the
  opposite constraint of :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.TruePositiveRateParity`
  to be used with reductions techniques.

* Add new constraints and objectives in :class:`~fairlearn.postprocessing.ThresholdOptimizer`

* Add class :code:`InterpolatedThresholder` to represent the fitted
  :class:`~fairlearn.postprocessing.ThresholdOptimizer`

* Add :py:mod:`fairlearn.datasets` module.

* Change the method to make copies of the estimator in
  :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient`
  from :code:`pickle.dump` to :code:`sklearn.clone`. 

* Add an argument :code:`sample_weight_name` to
  :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.GridSearch` and
  :class:`~fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient` to control how
  :code:`sample_weight` is supplied to :code:`estimator.fit`.

* Large changes to the metrics API.
  A new class :class:`~fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` has been
  introduced, and :code:`make_group_summary()` removed (along with related
  functions). Please see the documentation and examples for more information.

Migrating to v0.5.0 from v0.4.6
-------------------------------

The update from v0.4.6 to v0.5.0 of Fairlearn has brought some major changes.
This section goes through the adjustments required.

Metrics
^^^^^^^

We have substantially altered the :mod:`fairlearn.metrics` module.
In place of calling :code:`group_summary()` to produce a
:obj:`sklearn.utils.Bunch` containing the disaggregated metrics, we have a
new class, :class:`.MetricFrame`. The key advantages of the new API are:

- Support for evaluating multiple metric functions at once
- Support for multiple sensitive features
- Support for control features

The :class:`.MetricFrame` class has a constructor similar to
:code:`group_summary()`.
In v0.4.6, one would write

.. code-block::

    gs = group_summary(metric_func, y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=A_col)

With the new API, this becomes

.. code-block::

    mf = MetricFrame(metrics=metric_func, y_true=y_true, y_pred=y_pred, sensitive_features=A_col)

The new object has :attr:`.MetricFrame.overall` and
:attr:`.MetricFrame.by_group` properties, to access the metric evaluated on
the entire dataset, and the metric evaluated on the subgroups of
:code:`A_col`.

In v0.4.6, we provided the following aggregator functions to compute a single
scalar from the result of :code:`group_summary()`.

- :code:`group_min_from_summary()`
- :code:`group_max_from_summary()`
- :code:`difference_from_summary()`
- :code:`ratio_from_summary()`

With :class:`.MetricFrame` these become methods:

- :meth:`.MetricFrame.group_min`
- :meth:`.MetricFrame.group_max`
- :meth:`.MetricFrame.difference`
- :meth:`.MetricFrame.ratio`

Before, one might write:

.. code-block::

    min_by_group = group_min_from_summary(gs)

Now, one can write:

.. code-block::

    min_by_group = mf.group_min()

The :code:`make_derived_metric()` function has been removed, but will be
reintroduced in a future release. The predefined convenience functions such as
:code:`accuracy_score_group_min()` and :code:`precision_score_difference()`
remain.

For an introduction to all the new features, see the 
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_new_metrics.py` example in
:ref:`examples`.


Renamed object attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the object attributes have been renamed from :code:`_<name>` to
:code:`<name>_`.
For example in both :class:`.ExponentiatedGradient` and :class:`.GridSearch`,
the :code:`_predictors` attribute is now called :code:`predictors_`.


Exponentiated Gradient and Moments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the trailing underscore change mentioned above, several
adjustments have been made to the constructor arguments of
:class:`.ExponentiatedGradient`.
The :code:`T` argument has been renamed to :code:`max_iter`, and the
:code:`eta_mul` argument to :code:`eta0`.

Furthermore, the :code:`eps` argument was previously used for two
different purposes, and these two uses have now been separated.
The use of :code:`eps` as the righthand side of the constraints
has now been moved to the :class:`.Moment` classes.
The only remaining use of the :code:`eps` argument
is to control the optimality requirements for the optimization
algorithm in :class:`.ExponentiatedGradient`.

For classification moments, :code:`ConditionalSelectionRate` has been
renamed to :class:`.UtilityParity`, and there are three new
constructor arguments: :code:`difference_bound`, :code:`ratio_bound` (which
replaces :code:`ratio`) and :code:`ratio_bound_slack`.

For regression moments, :class:`.BoundedGroupLoss` and its
subclasses have gained a new argument :code:`upper_bound` to serve as
the righthand side of the constraints.

Several :class:`.Moment` objects have also been renamed in an effort
to improve consistency:

- :code:`ErrorRateRatio` has become :class:`.ErrorRateParity` (when used
  with the :code:`ratio_bound` and :code:`ratio_bound_slack` arguments)
- :code:`TruePositiveRateDifference` has become
  :class:`.TruePositiveRateParity` (when used with the
  :code:`difference_bound` argument)
- :code:`ConditionalSelectionRate` has become :class:`.UtilityParity`
- :code:`GroupLossMoment` has become :class:`.BoundedGroupLoss`
