v0.5.0
======

* Adjust classes to abide by naming conventions for attributes.
* Change `ExponentiatedGradient` signature by renaming argument `T` to
  `max_iter`, `eta_mul` to `eta0`, and by adding `run_linprog_step`.
* API refactoring to separate out different uses of `eps` within
  `ExponentiatedGradient`. It is now solely responsible for setting the L1
  norm bound in the optimization (which controls the excess constraint
  violation beyond what is allowed by the `constraints` object).
  The other usage of `eps` as the right-hand side of constraints is
  now captured directly in the moment classes as follows:
  * Classification moments: `ConditionalSelectionRate` renamed to
    `UtilityParity` and its subclasses have new arguments on the constructor:
    * `difference_bound` - for difference-based constraints such as
      demographic parity difference
    * `ratio_bound_slack` - for ratio-based constraints such as demographic
      parity ratio
    * Additionally, there's a `ratio_bound` argument which represents the
      argument previously called `ratio`.
  * Regression moments: `ConditionalLossMoment` and its subclasses have a new
    argument `upper_bound` with the same purpose for newly enabled regression
    scenarios on `ExponentiatedGradient`.
  For a comprehensive overview of available constraints refer to the new [user
  guide on fairness constraints for reductions methods](https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/mitigation.html#reductions).
* Renamed several constraints to create a uniform naming convention according
  to the accepted [metric harmonization proposal](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn-proposals/blob/master/api/METRICS.md):
  * `ErrorRateRatio` renamed to `ErrorRateParity`, and
    `TruePositiveRateDifference` renamed to `TruePositiveRateParity` since the
    desired pattern is `<metric name>Parity` with the exception of
    `EqualizedOdds` and `DemographicParity`.
  * `ConditionalSelectionRate` renamed to `UtilityParity`.
  * `GroupLossMoment` renamed to `BoundedGroupLoss` in order to have a
    descriptive name and for consistency with the paper. Similarly,
    `AverageLossMoment` renamed to `MeanLoss`.
  For a comprehensive overview of available constraints refer to the new [user
  guide on fairness constraints for reductions methods](https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/mitigation.html#reductions).
* Added `TrueNegativeRateParity` to provide the opposite constraint of
  `TruePositiveRateParity` to be used with reductions techniques.
* Add new constraints and objectives in `ThresholdOptimizer`
* Add class `InterpolatedThresholder` to represent the fitted
  `ThresholdOptimizer`
* Add `fairlearn.datasets` module.
* Change the method to make copies of the estimator in `ExponentiatedGradient`
  from `pickle.dump` to `sklearn.clone`. 
* Add an argument `sample_weight_name` to `GridSearch` and
  `ExponentiatedGradient` to control how `sample_weight` is supplied to
  `estimator.fit`.
* Large changes to the metrics API. A new class `MetricFrame` has been
  introduced, and `make_group_summary()` removed (along with related
  functions). Please see the documentation and examples for more information.

Migrating to v0.5.0 from v0.4.6
-------------------------------

The update from v0.4.6 to v0.5.0 of Fairlearn has brought some major changes. This
document goes through the adjustments required.

Metrics
^^^^^^^

We have substantially altered the :mod:`fairlearn.metrics` module.
In place of calling ``group_summary()`` to produce a :obj:`sklearn.utils.Bunch`
containing the disaggregated metrics, we have a new class, :class:`.MetricFrame`.
The key advantages of the new API are:

    - Support for evalulating multiple metric functions at once
    - Support for multiple sensitive features
    - Support for control features

The :class:`.MetricFrame` class has a constructor similar to ``group_summary()``.
In v0.4.6, one would write

.. code-block::

    gs = group_summary(metric_func, y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=A_col)

With the new API, this becomes

.. code-block::

    mf = MetricFrame(metrics=metric_func, y_true=y_true, y_pred=y_pred, sensitive_features=A_col)

The new object has :attr:`.MetricFrame.overall` and :attr:`.MetricFrame.by_group`
properties, to access the metric evaluated on the entire dataset, and the metric
evaluated on the subgroups of ``A_col``.

In v0.4.6, we provided the following aggregator functions to compute a single scalar
from the result of ``group_summary()``.

    - ``group_min_from_summary()``
    - ``group_max_from_summary()``
    - ``difference_from_summary()``
    - ``ratio_from_summary()``

With :class:`.MetricFrame` these become methods:

    - :meth:`.MetricFrame.group_min`
    - :meth:`.MetricFrame.group_max`
    - :meth:`.MetricFrame.difference`
    - :meth:`.MetricFrame.ratio`

Before, one might write:

.. code-block::

    min_by_group = group_min_from_summary(gs)

Now, one can write:

.. code-block::

    min_by_group = mf.group_min()

The ``make_derived_metric()`` function has been removed, but will be reintroduced
in a future release. The predefined convenience functions such as ``accuracy_score_group_min()``
and ``precision_score_difference()`` remain.

For an introduction to all the new features, see the 
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_new_metrics.py` example in
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples`.


Renamed object attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the object attributes have been renamed from ``_<name>`` to ``<name>_``.
For example in both :class:`.ExponentiatedGradient` and :class:`.GridSearch`,
the ``_predictors`` attribute is now called ``predictors_``.


Exponentiated Gradient and Moments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the trailing underscore change mentioned above, several
adjustments have been made to the constructor arguments of
:class:`.ExponentiatedGradient`.
The ``T`` argument has been renamed to ``max_iter``, and the ``eta_mul``
argument to ``eta0``.

Furthermore, the ``eps`` argument was previously used for two
different purposes, and these two uses have now been separated.
The use of ``eps`` as the righthand side of the constraints
has now been moved to the :class:`.Moment` classes.
The only remaining use of the ``eps`` argument
is to control the optimality requirements for the optimization
algorithm in :class:`.ExponentiatedGradient`.

For classification moments, ``ConditionalSelectionRate`` has been
renamed to :class:`.UtilityParity`, and there are three new
constructor arguments: ``difference_bound``, ``ratio_bound`` (which
replaces ``ratio``) and ``ratio_bound_slack``.

For regression moments, :class:`.BoundedGroupLoss` and its
subclasses have gained a new argument ``upper_bound`` to serve as
the righthand side of the constraints.

Several :class:`.Moment` objects have also been renamed in an effort
to improve consistency:

    - ``ErrorRateRatio`` has become :class:`.ErrorRateParity` (when used
      with the ``ratio_bound`` and ``ratio_bound_slack`` arguments)
    - ``TruePositiveRateDifference`` has become :class:`.TruePositiveRateParity`
      (when used with the ``difference_bound`` argument)
    - ``ConditionalSelectionRate`` has become :class:`.UtilityParity`
    - ``GroupLossMoment`` has become :class:`.BoundedGroupLoss`
