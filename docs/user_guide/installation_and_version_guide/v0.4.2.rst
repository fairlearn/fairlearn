v0.4.2
------

* If methods such as `predict` are called before `fit`, `sklearn`'s
  `NotFittedError` is raised instead of `NotFittedException`, and the latter
  is now removed.
* Separated out matplotlib dependency into an extension that can be installed
  via `pip install fairlearn[customplots]`.
* Added a `GroupMetricSet` class to hold collections of `GroupMetricResult`
  objects
