v0.4.2
------

* If methods such as :code:`predict` are called before :code:`fit`, a
  :class:`sklearn.exceptions.NotFittedError` is raised instead of
  :code:`NotFittedException`, and the latter is now removed.
* Separated out :code:matplotlib dependency into an extension that can be
  installed via :code:`pip install fairlearn[customplots]`.
* Added a :code:`GroupMetricSet` class to hold collections of
  :code:`GroupMetricResult` objects
