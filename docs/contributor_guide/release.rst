Release Process
---------------

This page outlines the process for creating a new Fairlearn release.
The following steps assume git remote's :code:`origin` points to
:code:`fairlearn/fairlearn`.

#. Ensure the maintainers listed in :code:`scripts/generate_maintainers_table.py`
   are up to date. Run the command below from the repository root directory:

   .. prompt:: bash

            python scripts/generate_maintainers_table.py

   If the generated file :code:`docs/about/maintainers.rst` does not change
   you can proceed with the next step. Otherwise, create a PR to update
   the generated maintainers file on the :code:`main` branch. Proceed only
   when the PR is merged.

#. Check the :code:`docs/user_guide/installation_and_version_guide` for a file
   related to the release. Make sure formatting and contents are correct and
   create a summary of the highlights at the top of the file. Create a PR
   for this and merge it before proceeding.

#. If this is a non-patch release:

    #. Create a new branch:

        .. prompt:: bash

            git checkout -b release/v<x.y>.X

    #. Push the branch to GitHub:

        .. prompt:: bash

            git push -u origin release/v<x.y>.X

       You may need to temporarily add an exception to the
       `branch protection rules <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/settings/branches>`_
       by adding a new branch protection rule for :code:`release/v<x.y>.X`.

#. On the release branch, create a PR to update the version in :code:`__init__.py`
   to :code:`x.y.z` (where :code:`z=0` for the first release from a branch)

#. Merge that PR.

#. Run the `Release Wheel workflow on GitHub <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/actions/workflows/release-wheel.yml>`_

.. note::
    Ensure that you have selected the correct release branch

#. On the release branch, place an annotated tag:

        .. prompt:: bash

            git tag -a v<x.y.z> -m "v<x.y.z> release"

#. Push the tag to GitHub:

        .. prompt:: bash

            git push origin v<x.y.z>

#. On `GitHub's release page <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/releases>`_,
   draft a new release. Choose the new tag, title the release `v<x.y.z>`,
   and post the changes from the release file within :code:`docs/user_guide/installation_and_version_guide`
   into the description, then hit "publish".

#. On the :code:`main` branch, create a PR to:

    #. Update the version in :code:`__init__.py` to :code:`x.y+1.z.dev0`
    #. Update the version in :code:`docs/static_landing_page/js/landing_page.js`
       so that all the links point to the new release
    #. Update the :code:`docs/_static/versions.json` file
    #. Create a new file :code:`vx.y+1.z.rst` in :code:`docs/user_guide/installation_and_version_guide`

.. note::
    Make sure to add a note to the PR:
    "Do not merge until the release is completed. Otherwise a new website will
    be published that points to the new version which doesn't exist yet."

#. Merge the PR.
