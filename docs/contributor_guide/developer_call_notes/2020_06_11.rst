Agenda:
- new website at https://fairlearn.github.io/
    - please provide feedback and feel free to submit PRs to update/edit/add
      content or styling
    - content in the process of getting created, please help if you're
      interested! This includes
        - user guides
        - roadmap, vision/mission, FAQ
        - contributor guide
- Governance
    - copyright updated to "Copyright Microsoft Corporation and contributors"
    - short-term:
        - define how to become core dev
        - define requirements for contributions to be accepted
    - long-term:
        - Would it help for Fairlearn to become a foundation / charity?
          At which point? This will likely be something to keep revisiting.
            - NumFocus may perhaps be an option?
            - definitely need to transition to a different model if there are
              outside institutional contributors (possibly earlier) or if we
              reach a larger scale.
- Several things are blocking people from contributing that we need to address
    - lack of roadmap makes it hard to understand what's going on
        - A short term roadmap should make it transparent to everyone what
          efforts are in progress. This will make it easier for contributors
          to understand where they can contribute.
        - A long term roadmap should indicate where the project is headed.
          This helps (potential) contributors in figuring out whether their
          interests are aligned with the project.
- Metrics
    - Simplicity/usability and more complex metrics group objects with richer
      functionality don't need to be mutually exclusive. We will iterate on
      the current state.
- Notebooks
    - development process needs to be established
    - porting notebooks from `notebooks` over to `examples` as a good first 
      issue
    - To work out proper examples with a focus on sociotechnical framing we'll
      set up a weekly hour where everyone who wants to discuss and contribute
      can do so. It'll be at the same time as the developer call
      (Thursday 8am)
- UX
    - There's already a separate call scheduled (originally meant to be on
      6/12, but had to be rescheduled to next week) to discuss various kinds
      of potential UX research directions.
    - Beyond that there's an immediate need to remove obstacles to contribute
      to the UX. Clarifying the roadmap as mentioned above is one step in this
      journey. Currently the contributor guide is focused entirely on Python
      code, with basically no explanation on how to work with the typescript
      based dashboard.
