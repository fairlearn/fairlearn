Agenda:

- Requirements for next release
    - Still need new metrics API
    - Need to announce deprecation of ``FairlearnDashboard``
    - Need to make sure Quickstart will actually work
      (short term fix: put note about running `pip install` against GitHub at the top)
    - Roman is writing up a userguide for ``ThresholdOptimizer``

  To clear up confusion over the ``FairlearnDashboard``, it has been updated with a
  ``flask`` backend but we have rolled back the major UI change which had been put
  in (after the ``v0.4.6`` release). We plan on deprecating the ``FairlearnDashboard``
  within Fairlearn, since its code has been moved to an explicitly Microsoft-owned
  repository (which will be open sourced Real Soon Now), since there are
  Azure-imposed requirements on that code. The Fairlearn community will then be
  free to add any desired visualisations within Fairlearn in the future.

- Governance

    An update from Miro. Probably won't be ready for the October NumFocus application
    deadline, but Microsoft will hopefully separate Fairlearn as a neutral organisation
    during October. This will remove the need for things like `Security.md` which are not
    particularly open source friendly.

- Naming the metrics API

    With the basic API for the new style metrics agreed, we need to decide on names for
    everything. This is currently
    `an open issue <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn-proposals/issues/17>`_
    and *really* needs to be brought to resolution.

    We had a lengthy discussion. There was a feeling that `MetricFrame` would be better than
    `GroupedMetric` for the whole class, but we did not agree on alternatives for
    `conditional_features=`. At Kevin's suggestion to focus on how users will first encounter
    the code, Richard will rewrite the example code
    introducing the new metric API to be focussed on the sociotechnical side, rather than
    just an API demonstration. We will also reach out to Solon Barocas.
