Agenda:

- UX refactoring

    - `Proposal <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn-proposals/pull/14>`_
      published earlier this week.

    - Feedback:

        - user guides need to reflect the separation
        - all steps required need to be outlined
        - make it clear and easy how to contribute to UI
        - communication around UI repo should also be open
        - proposal needs to address community-driven UI development, not just
          the future of the existing UI under a Microsoft repo.

- datasets module - skipped this since Hilde / Vincent should be involved

- webpage redesign:
    - Vanessa has some capacity
    - effort starting soon --> anyone interested please reach out
