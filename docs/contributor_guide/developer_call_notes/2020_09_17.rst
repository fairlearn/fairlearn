Agenda:

- Datasets module: keep or remove?

    - not part of a release yet (so removing would be easy)
    - reasons for including are technical:

        - show how to use a function (create "minimal examples")
        - benchmark algorithms, e.g., how well they optimize
          fairness/performance trade-off under specific quantitative
          definitions of fairness and performance
    
    - but including datasets means we should address sociotechnical aspects
    - we don't add real functionality, just use functionality from
      `sklearn.datasets`, namely `fetch_openml`

        - potential value prop: we can return sensitive features in addition
          to X, y

    - e.g., https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/519

    - other options (other than keep/remove):

        - don't spend more time on it
        - remove module, but move content into examples

    - Roman to summarize this info in an issue and get Vincent's feedback

- Should we restructure our weekly sessions?

    - current situation:

        - developer call once a month (2nd Thursday of each month, today being
          an exception)
        - sociotechnical deep dive on all other Thursdays

    - changes to this schedule are possible
    - Feedback: get agenda out at least a couple of days before the call!

- Metrics API progress

    - Proposal: https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn-proposals/pull/15 
      --> Richard started
      `implementation <https://github.com/riedgar-ms/fairlearn/blob/riedgar-ms/return-of-the-GMR/test/unit/metrics/experimental/sample_code.py>`_
    - https://hackmd.io/zMSG-_oWSxOs-AVbLwNywQ

- UI recap

    - Proposal for existing widget: 
      https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn-proposals/pull/14
    - PR to add matplotlib plots to Fairlearn: 
      https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/561
    - if there's a need for other kinds of visualizations beyond matplotlib
      we can add other repos within the Fairlearn org
