Contributing example notebooks
------------------------------

To contribute new example notebooks please submit a pull request. We have
certain requirements that need to be satisfied to contribute a notebook. Those
include:

* Clear structure
* Appropriate framing of the problem while respecting that fairness is a
  fundamentally sociotechnical challenge
* Usage of at least some part of Fairlearn

Good examples of existing notebooks that abide by these requirements are:

* `Mitigating Disparities in Ranking from Binary Data <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/master/notebooks/Mitigating%20Disparities%20in%20Ranking%20from%20Binary%20Data.ipynb>`_
* `Binary Classification with the UCI Credit-card Default Dataset <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/master/notebooks/Binary%20Classification%20with%20the%20UCI%20Credit-card%20Default%20Dataset.ipynb>`_
