Contributing example notebooks
------------------------------

.. note::

    Current work on example notebooks is captured in the corresponding
    `project board <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/projects/3>`_.
    If you want to help us improve them please `reach out <communication>`_!
    A great way to get started is through our
    :ref:`application-specific deep dive sessions <notebook_deep_dive>`.

To contribute new example notebooks please submit a pull request. We have
certain requirements that need to be satisfied to contribute a notebook. Those
include:

* Clear structure
* Appropriate framing of the problem while respecting that fairness is a
  fundamentally sociotechnical challenge
* Usage of at least some part of Fairlearn

Good examples of existing notebooks that abide by these requirements are:

* `Mitigating Disparities in Ranking from Binary Data <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/master/notebooks/Mitigating%20Disparities%20in%20Ranking%20from%20Binary%20Data.ipynb>`_
* `Binary Classification with the UCI Credit-card Default Dataset <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/blob/master/notebooks/Binary%20Classification%20with%20the%20UCI%20Credit-card%20Default%20Dataset.ipynb>`_
