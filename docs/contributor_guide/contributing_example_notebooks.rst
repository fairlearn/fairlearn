Contributing example notebooks
------------------------------

We'd love to collaborate with anyone interested in describing scenarios for using fairlearn!

When discussing and critiquing examples, here are some lenses to consider:

Microrubric for critiques:
"""""""""""""""""""""
1. **Deployment context**: Describes a real deployment context, not just a dataset.
2. **For developers**: Speaks the language of developers and data scientists.  Considers real practitioner needs.  Fits within the lifecycle of real practioner work.  See `Holstein et al (2019) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05239.pdf>`_, `Madaio et al. (2020) <http://www.jennwv.com/papers/checklists.pdf>`_.
3. **Sociotechnical**: Models the team's value that fairness as a sociotechnical challenge.    Avoids abstraction traps.  See `Selbst et al. (2020) <https://andrewselbst.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/selbst-et-al-fairness-and-abstraction-in-sociotechnical-systems.pdf>`_.
4. **Open**:  Discusses tradeoffs and compares alternatives.  Illustrates how fairlearn contributes.
5. **Real harms**: Focuses on real harms to real people.  See `Blodget et al. (2020) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14050>`_.
