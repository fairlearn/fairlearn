Contributing example notebooks
------------------------------

We'd love to collaborate with anyone interested in describing scenarios for using Fairlearn!

A good example notebook exhibits the following attributes:

1. **Deployment context**: Describes a real deployment context, not just a dataset.
2. **Real harms**: Focuses on real harms to real people.  See `Blodget et al. (2020) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14050>`_.
3. **Sociotechnical**: Models the Fairlearn team's value that fairness is a sociotechnical challenge.    Avoids abstraction traps.  See `Selbst et al. (2020) <https://andrewselbst.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/selbst-et-al-fairness-and-abstraction-in-sociotechnical-systems.pdf>`_.
4. **Substantiated**: Discusses trade-offs and compares alternatives. Describes why using particular Fairlearn functionalities makes sense.
5. **For developers**: Speaks the language of developers and data scientists.  Considers real practitioner needs.  Fits within the lifecycle of real practioner work.  See `Holstein et al (2019) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05239.pdf>`_, `Madaio et al. (2020) <http://www.jennwv.com/papers/checklists.pdf>`_.

Please keep these in mind when creating, discussing, and critiquing examples.
