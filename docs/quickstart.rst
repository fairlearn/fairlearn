dependencies, please check out the :ref:`installation_guide`.

If you are updating from a previous version of Fairlearn, please
see :ref:`version_guide`.

.. note::

    The Fairlearn API is still evolving, so example code in
    this documentation may not work with every version of Fairlearn.
    Please use the version selector to get to the instructions for
    the appropriate version. The instructions for the :code:`main`
    branch require Fairlearn to be installed from a clone of the
    repository.

Overview of Fairlearn
---------------------

The Fairlearn package has two components:

- *Metrics* for assessing which groups are negatively impacted by a model,
  and for comparing multiple models in terms of various fairness and accuracy
  metrics.

- *Algorithms* for mitigating unfairness in a variety of AI tasks and along a
  variety of fairness definitions.

Fairlearn in 10 minutes
-----------------------

The Fairlearn toolkit can assist in assessing and mitigation unfairness in
Machine Learning models. It's impossible to provide a sufficient overview of
fairness in ML in this Quickstart tutorial, so we highly recommend starting
with our :ref:`user_guide`. Fairness is a fundamentally sociotechnical
challenge and cannot be solved with technical tools alone. They may be helpful
for certain tasks such as assessing unfairness through various metrics, or to
mitigate observed unfairness when training a model. Additionally, fairness has
different definitions in different contexts and it may not be possible to
represent it quantitatively at all.

Given these considerations this Quickstart tutorial merely provides short
code snippet examples of how to use basic Fairlearn functionality for those
who are already intimately familiar with fairness in ML. The example below
is about binary classification, but we similarly support regression.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to run the code samples in the Quickstart tutorial, you need to
install the following dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install fairlearn matplotlib

Loading the dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this example, we use a `clinical dataset <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008>`_
of hospital re-admissions over a ten-year period (1998-2008) for
diabetic patients across 130 different hospitals in the U.S. This scenario
builds upon prior research on how racial disparities impact health care
resource allocation in the U.S. For an in-depth analysis of this dataset,
review the `SciPy tutorial <https://github.com/fairlearn/talks/tree/main/2021_scipy_tutorial>`_
that the Fairlearn team presented in 2021.

We will use machine learning to predict whether an individual in the dataset
is readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of hospital release.
A hospital readmission within 30 days can be viewed as a proxy that the
patients needed more assistance at the release time.
In the next section, we build a classification model to accomplish the
prediction task.

.. doctest:: quickstart

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from fairlearn.datasets import fetch_diabetes_hospital
    >>> data = fetch_diabetes_hospital(as_frame=True)
    >>> X = data.data.copy()
    >>> X.drop(columns=["readmitted", "readmit_binary"], inplace=True)
    >>> y = data.target
    >>> X_ohe = pd.get_dummies(X)
    >>> race = X['race']
    >>> race.value_counts()
    race
    Caucasian          76099
    AfricanAmerican    19210
    Unknown             2273
    Hispanic            2037
    Other               1506
    Asian                641

Evaluating fairness-related metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, Fairlearn provides fairness-related metrics that can be compared
between groups and for the overall population. Using existing metric
definitions from
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.metrics>`_
we can evaluate metrics for subgroups within the data as below:

.. doctest:: quickstart
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame
    >>> from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, balanced_accuracy_score
    >>> from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    >>> np.random.seed(42)  # set seed for consistent results
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, A_train, A_test = train_test_split(X_ohe, y, race, random_state=123)
    >>> classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=10, max_depth=4)
    >>> classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
    DecisionTreeClassifier(...)
    >>> y_pred = (classifier.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1] >= 0.1)
    >>> mf = MetricFrame(metrics=accuracy_score, y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred, sensitive_features=A_test)
    >>> mf.overall.item()
    0.514...
    >>> mf.by_group
    race
    AfricanAmerican    0.530935
    Asian              0.658683
    Caucasian          0.503535
    Hispanic           0.612524
    Other              0.591549
    Unknown            0.574576
    Name: accuracy_score, dtype: float64

Note that our decision threshold for positive predictions is 0.1.
In practice, this threshold would be driven by risk or capacity
considerations. For this example, we set the threshold based on the risk
of readmission. The threshold of 0.1 corresponds to saying that a
10% risk of readmission is viewed as sufficient for referral to a
post-discharge care program.
Fairlearn has many standard metrics built-in, such as
false negative rate, i.e., the rate of occurrence of negative classifications
when the true value of the outcome label is positive.
In the context of this dataset, the false positive rate captures the
individuals who in reality would be readmitted to the hospital, but
the model does not predict that outcome.

.. doctest:: quickstart
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> from fairlearn.metrics import false_negative_rate
    >>> mf = MetricFrame(metrics=false_negative_rate, y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred, sensitive_features=A_test)
    >>> mf.overall.item()
    0.309...
    >>> mf.by_group
    race
    AfricanAmerican    0.296089
    Asian              0.500000
    Caucasian          0.308555
    Hispanic           0.307692
    Other              0.333333
    Unknown            0.420000
    Name: false_negative_rate, dtype: float64

Fairlearn also allows us to quickly plot these metrics from the
:class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame`

.. literalinclude:: auto_examples/plot_quickstart.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: # Analyze metrics using MetricFrame
    :end-before: # Customize plots with ylim

Mitigating disparity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If we observe disparities between groups we may want to create a new model
while specifying an appropriate fairness constraint. Note that the choice of
fairness constraints is crucial for the resulting model, and varies based on
application context. Since both false positives and false negatives are relevant for fairness in this
hypothetical example, we can attempt to mitigate the observed disparity using the
fairness constraint called Equalized Odds, which bounds disparities in both types of error. In real world
applications we need to be mindful of the sociotechnical context when making
such decisions. The Exponentiated Gradient mitigation technique used fits the
provided classifier using Equalized Odds as the constraint and a suitably weighted Error Rate
as the objective, leading to a vastly reduced difference in accuracy:

.. doctest:: quickstart
    :options:  +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> from fairlearn.reductions import ErrorRate, EqualizedOdds, ExponentiatedGradient
    >>> objective = ErrorRate(costs={'fp': 0.1, 'fn': 0.9})
    >>> constraint = EqualizedOdds(difference_bound=0.01)
    >>> classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=10, max_depth=4)
    >>> mitigator = ExponentiatedGradient(classifier, constraint, objective=objective)
    >>> mitigator.fit(X_train, y_train, sensitive_features=A_train)
    ExponentiatedGradient(...)
    >>> y_pred_mitigated = mitigator.predict(X_test)
    >>> mf_mitigated = MetricFrame(metrics=accuracy_score, y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred_mitigated, sensitive_features=A_test)
    >>> mf_mitigated.overall.item()
    0.5251...
    >>> mf_mitigated.by_group
    race
    AfricanAmerican    0.524358
    Asian              0.562874
    Caucasian          0.525588
    Hispanic           0.549902
    Other              0.478873
    Unknown            0.511864
    Name: accuracy_score, dtype: float64

Note that :class:`.ExponentiatedGradient` does not have a `predict_proba`
method, but we can adjust the target decision threshold by specifying
(possibly unequal) costs for false positives and false negatives.
In our example we use the cost of 0.1 for false positives and 0.9 for false negatives.
Without fairness constraints, this would exactly correspond to
referring patients with the readmission risk of 10% or higher
(as we used earlier).
