# Documentation & Website Generation

This directory contains the content relevant to documentation & website
generation using `sphinx`. The most important resource is `conf.py` which
includes settings and extensions that `sphinx` uses including the theme,
gallery (example notebooks), and LaTeX macros.

We use restructured text (ReST) because of the rich functionality to easily
link between pages, add mathematical formulas, and because it's widely used
for the same purpose in other projects like `scikit-learn`.
