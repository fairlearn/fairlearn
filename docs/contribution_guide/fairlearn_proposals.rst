API and design proposals
------------------------

Design proposals for larger changes go into the
`fairlearn-proposals repository <https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn-proposals>`_.
If you want to submit a proposal, just create a pull request there to
kickstart the review and discussion. You can also submit an issue there, where
you formulate the shortcomings of the existing framework and/or desired
aspects of a new framework.
