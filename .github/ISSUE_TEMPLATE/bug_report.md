#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
<!--

Be as succinct as possible, do not depend on external data. In short, we are
going to copy-paste your code and we expect to get the same result as you.

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd
from fairlearn.reductions import ExponentiatedGradient, DemographicParity
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from fairlearn.datasets import fetch_adult

data = fetch_adult(as_frame=True)
X = pd.get_dummies(data.data)
y = (data.target == '>50K') * 1
sensitive_features = data.data['sex']
mitigator = ExponentiatedGradient(LinearRegression(), DemographicParity())
mitigator.fit(X, y, sensitive_features=sensitive_features)
```
If the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link
