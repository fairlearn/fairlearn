# This CircleCI workflow builds our documentation into HTML pages.
# The generated pages are viewable as artifacts in CircleCI.
# CircleCI can be run on PRs from forks & allows viewing stored artifacts
# without download. Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions currently don't
# support certain actions on PRs from forks so we can't use them for this.
