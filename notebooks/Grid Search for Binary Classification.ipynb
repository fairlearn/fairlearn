    "This notebook goes through applying the `grid_search` algorithm in FairLearn to a binary classification problem, where we also have a binary protected attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific problem we consider a biased credit scoring problem. We assume that we have a collection of individuals characterised by two features - a credit score in the range $[0, 1]$ and a binary protected attribute from ${a_0, a_1}$. We also have a binary 'score' for each individual indicating whether or not they got a loan. This is determined by applying a threshold to their credit score, and to make the dataset unfair, we can set different thresholds for the two groups $a_0$ and $a_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple case, we make the protected attribute and the credit score available to both the learner and the model. This gives us a straightforward method of assessing fairness - look at the model, and see if zero weight is put on the protected attribute."
