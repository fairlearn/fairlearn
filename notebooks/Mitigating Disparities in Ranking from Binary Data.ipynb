    "We consider the task of ranking students for admission to law school using the data collected in [Law School Admissions Council's (LSAC) National Longitudinal Bar Passage Study](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED469370); specifically, the version downloaded from [Project SEAPHE](http://www.seaphe.org/databases.php). We highlight some of the fairness considerations that come up not only in school admissions, but also in other ranking scenarios. Necessarily, our example is simplified and ignores many real-world considerations specific to school admissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set contains information about law students collected by LSAC between 1991 and 1997. Some of the information is available at the admission time (such as the undergraduate GPA and LSAT score), and some describes the performance of the students once admitted. We also have access to their self-identified race. To simplify this example, we will limit the attention to those self-identified as **black** and **white** (two largest groups) and restrict our attention to two features (undergraduate GPA and LSAT score).\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with ranking law school applicants, we train a model that uses the information that is available about a student at the admission time to predict the probability that they will pass their bar exam. The predictions of our model are intended to be used (among other factors) by admission officers to select the applicants. After training the initial model, we examine differences in the predictions it induces across two the two groups. We then mitigate these differences using three Fairlearn algorithms: `GridSearch`, `ThresholdOptimizer` and `ExponentiatedGradient`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage notes:** This notebook is intended as an example of Fairlearn functionality and not a fully realistic case study of an admission scenario. In real world, one should think carefully about whether it is appropriate to rank or score individuals. Also, additional features beyond the two considered here (GPA and LSAT scores) should be considered in practice, as recommended by the authors of the [LSAC study](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED469370). Finally, in real-world settings, it would be inappropriate to restrict attention to only two of the subgroups without evaluating the impacts on other individuals."

    "The majority of the students in the study are white. There is a notable gap between white and black students in their incoming academic credentials: the 75th percentile of the LSAT scores of black students is lower than the 25th percentile of the LSAT scores among white students. There is a less severe, but still substantial gap in UGPA. The achievement gap is greatly diminished in terms of the bar passage rate (78% for black students and 97% for white students). The authors of the [LSAC study](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED469370) conclude that this justifies admission practices that look beyond LSAT and UGPA.

AUC is equal to the probability that a randomly chosen positive example (i.e., a student who passes the bar) is scored above a randomly chosen negative example (i.e., a student who does not pass the bar). An AUC of 0.5 means that the scores are no better than a random coin flip, whereas AUC of 1.0 means that the scores perfectly separate positives from negatives. The AUC metric has two desirable properties: (1) it is preserved by monotone transformations of the score, and (2) it is not sensitive to the imbalance between positives and negatives, which is quite severe in our example, with the overall bar passage rate above 94%.\n",

We then consider all possible thresholds on the value of the score, and for each threshold check the fraction of black vs white students above the threshold. The largest observed difference across all possible thresholds is referred to as the **demographic parity difference** or **demographic disparity** (see [Agarwal et al. 2018](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/agarwal19d.html), where it is reffered to as SP disparity).

While the resulting logistic models mitigate the demographic disparity, they might not be well calibrated (unlike unmitigated logistic models), so we use Platt's scaling for [calibration](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html).

    "The outputs of a classifier are either 0 or 1, so it is possible to re-interpret the AUC of a classifier as the *balanced accuracy*, meaning the accuracy under the distribution re-weighted to have the same mass of positive and negative examples. Demographic disparity can also be interpreted as the difference between the rates at which the students of either race are classified as 1; we refer to this rate as the _selection rate_.\n",

    "\n",
    "We first show how to obtain low-disparity classifiers by thresholding scores&mdash;such as the scores produced by unmitigated logistic regression&mdash;using the postprocessing algorithm of [Hardt et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02413), implemented in the class  `ThresholdOptimizer`. This algorithm finds thresholds that optimize accuracy subject to the constraint that there be no demographic disparity on the training data. Since our goal here is to optimize _balanced_ accuracy rather than accuracy, we first re-balance the data by randomly subsampling positive examples, so they are equal in number to negative examples. We then pass this re-balanced data set to `ThresholdOptimizer`. Since the accuracy of a classifier on the re-balanced data set is in expectation equal to the AUC on the original data, `ThresholdOptimizer` now seeks to optimize our desired accuracy metric."

    "The original unmitigated scores have the demographic disparity around 0.6 (see [here](#disparity_unmitigated)). We see that `ThresholdOptimizer` dramatically reduces the disparity to around 0.1. At the same time, the AUC in each subpopulation is at or above 0.65, a moderate drop from the unmitigated values of 0.72 and 0.74 (see [here](#auc_unmitigated)). This is a more favorable trade-off than the one achieved by model 35 above, with the disparity of 0.4 and the worst-case AUC of around 0.62 (see [here](#grid_search_comparison)). However, note that `ThresholdOptimizer` is a classifier, and so it can only work as a crude ranker. Additionally, `ThresholdOptimizer` uses the sensitive feature (in this instance race) at the prediction time, by applying a different threshold to unmitigated scores depending on race. In some use cases, these two properties might be undesirable. We next show how to obtain a classifier that also seeks to achieve low demographic disparity, but without requiring access to the sensitive feature at the evaluation time.\n",
