The error in the chart is smallest in the top left corner. This is done as part of the `fit` step above, and we'll repeat it here for completeness. The yellow area is the overlap between the areas under the curve that are reachable with interpolation for both groups. Of course, this works for more than two groups as well. The result is that we have interpolated solutions for each group, i.e. every prediction is calculated as the weighted result of two threshold rules.\n",

    "The adjustment should happen to the higher one of the curves and essentially brings it closer to the diagonal as represented by `prediction_constant`. In this case this is not required since the curves intersect, but we are actually slightly inaccurate because we only determine the minimum error point on a grid of x values, instead of calculating the intersection point analytically. By choosing a large `grid_size` this can be alleviated."
