    "This way you end up with a set of points above the diagonal line connecting (0,0) and (1,1). We calculate the convex hull based on that, because we can reach any point in between two known thresholding points by interpolation. An interpolation could be $p_0 (x_0, y_0) + p_1 (x_1, y_1)$. For our post processing algorithm that would mean that we use the rule defined by $(x_0, y_0, \\text{operation}_0)$ $p_0$ percent of the time, and the rule defined by $(x_1, y_1, \\text{operation}_1)$ $p_1$ percent of the time, thus resulting in a probabilistic classifier. Depending on the data certain fairness objectives can only be accomplished with probabilistic classifiers. However, not every use case lends itself to probabilistic classifiers, since it could mean that two people with identical features are classified differently.\n",

The error in the chart is smallest in the top left corner. This is done as part of the `fit` step above, and we'll repeat it here for completeness. The yellow area is the overlap between the areas under the curve that are reachable with interpolation for both groups. Of course, this works for more than two groups as well. The result is that we have interpolated solutions for each group, i.e. every prediction is calculated as the weighted result of two threshold rules."
