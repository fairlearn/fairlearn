    "We consider the task of ranking students for admission to law school. We use the data collected in  [Law School Admissions Council's (LSAC) National Longitudinal Bar Passage Study](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED469370); specifically, the version downloaded from [Project SEAPHE](http://www.seaphe.org/databases.php). We highlight some of the fairness considerations that come up not only in school admissions, but also in other ranking scenarios. Necessarily, our example is simplified and ignores many real-world considerations specific to school admissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set contains information about law students collected by LSAC between 1991 and 1997. Some of the information is available at the admission time (such as the undergraduate GPA and LSAT score), and some describes the performance of the students once admitted. We also have access to their self-identified race. Throughout this exercise, we will limit the attention to those self-identified as **black** and **white** (two largest groups).\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with ranking law school applicants, we will train a model that uses the information that is available about a student at the admission time to predict the probability that they will pass their bar exam. The predictions of our model are intended to be used (among other factors) by admission officers to select the applicants. After training the initial model, we examine differences in the predictions it induces across two groups. We then mitigate these differences using `GridSearch` approach in `fairlearn`."

There is a notable gap between white and black students in their incoming academic credentials: the 75th percentile of the LSAT scores of black students is lower than the 25th percentile of the LSAT scores among white students. There is a less severe, but still substantial gap in UGPA. The achievement gap is greatly diminished in terms of the bar passage rate (78% for black students and 97% for white students). The authors of the [LSAC study](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED469370) conclude that this justifies admission practices that look beyond LSAT and UGPA.

Because of a high imbalance between positive and negative examples, our accuracy metric is the [area under the ROC curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve) (AUC). It is equal to the probability that a randomly chosen positive example is scored above a randomly chosen negative example. An AUC of 0.5 means that the evaluated scores are no better than a random coin flip, whereas AUC of 1.0 means that the evaluated scores are perfect.

Unlike standard logistic models, the models obtained by this approach might not be well calibrated, so we use Platt's scaling for [calibration](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html).
