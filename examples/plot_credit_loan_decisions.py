# Fairness considerations of credit loan decisions
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# Fairness and credit lending in the US
# =====================================
#
# In 2019, Apple received backlash on social media after its newly launched
# *Apple Card* product appeared to offer higher credit limits to men compared
# to women :footcite:`nedlund2019apple`.
# In multiple cases, married couples found the husband received a credit limit
# that was 10-20x higher than the wife's even when the couple had joint assets.
#
# From a regulatory perspective, financial institutions that operate within
# the United States are subject to *legal regulations* prohibiting
# discrimination on the `basis of race, gender, or other protected classes
# :footcite:`uscode2011title15chapter41subchapteriv`.
# With the increasing prevalence of automated decision-systems in the financial
# lending space, experts have raised concerns about whether these systems could
# exacerabate existing inequalities in financial lending.
#
# Although the two concepts are intertwined, algorithmic fairness is not the
# same concept as anti-discrimination law. An AI system can comply with
# anti-discrimination law while exhibiting fairness-related concerns. On the
# other hand, some fairness interventions may be illegal under
# anti-discrimination law.
# :footcite:cts:`Xiang2019legalcompatibility` discuss the compatibilities and
# disconnects between anti-discrimination law and algorithmic notions of
# fairness. In this case study, we focus on fairness in financial services
# rather than compliance with financial anti-discrimination regulations.
#
# Ernst & Young (EY) case study
# -----------------------------
#
# In this case study, we aim to replicate the work done in a white paper
# :footcite:`dudik2020assessing`,
# co-authored by *Microsoft* and *EY*, on mitigating gender-related performance
# disparities in financial lending decisions. In their analysis, Microsoft and
# EY demonstrated how Fairlearn could be used to measure and mitigate
# unfairness in the loan adjudication process.
#
# Using a dataset of credit loan outcomes (whether an individual defaulted on
# a credit loan), we train a fairness-unaware model to predict the likelihood
# an individual will default on a given loan. We use the Fairlearn toolkit for
# assessing the fairness of our model, according to several metrics.
# Finally, we perform two unfairness mitigation strategies on our model and
# compare the results to our original model.
#
# Because the dataset used in the white paper is not publicly available, we
# will introduce a semi-synthetic feature into an existing publicly available
# dataset to replicate the outcome disparity found in the original dataset.
#
# Credit decisions dataset
# ========================
#
# As mentioned, we will not be able to use the original loans dataset, and
# instead will be working with a publicly available dataset of credit card
# defaults in Taiwan collected in 2005. This dataset represents binary credit
# card default outcomes for 30,000 applicants with information pertaining to
# an applicant's payment history and bill statements over a six-month period
# from April 2005 to September 2005, as well as demographic information, such
# as *sex*, *age*, *marital status*, and *education level* of the applicant.
# A full summary of features is provided below:
#
# .. list-table::
#   :header-rows: 1
#   :stub-columns: 1
#
#   *  - features
#      - description
#   *  - sex, education, marriage, age
#      - demographic features
#   *  - pay_0, pay_2, pay_3, pay_4, pay_5, pay_6
#      - repayment status (ordinal)
#   *  - bill_amt1, bill_amt2, bill_amt3, bill_amt4, bill_amt5, bill_amt_6
#      - bill statement amount (Taiwan dollars)
#   *  - pay_amt1, pay_amt2, pay_amt3, pay_amt4, pay_amt5, pay_amt6
#      - previous statement amount (Taiwan dollars)
#   *  - default payment next month
#      - default information (1 = YES, 0 = NO)
#
# Let's pretend we are a data scientist at a financial institution who is
# tasked with developing a classification model to predict whether an
# applicant will default on a personal loan. A positive prediction by the
# model means the applicant would default on the credit loan.
# *Defaulting on a loan* means the client fails to make payments within a
# 30-day window, and the lender can take legal actions against the client.
#
# Although we do not have a dataset of loan default history, we do have this
# data set of credit card payment history. We assume customers who make
# monthly credit card payments on time are more *creditworthy*, and thus less
# likely to default on a personal credit loan.
#
# **Decision point: task definition**
#
# - **Defaulting on a credit card payment** can be viewed as a proxy for the
#   fact that an applicant might not be a good candidate for a personal loan.
# - Because most customers did not default on their credit card payment, we
#   will need to take this class imbalance into account during our modeling
#   process.
#
# As the data is read in-memory, we will change the column :code:`PAY_0` to
# :code:`PAY_1` to make the naming more consistent with the naming of the
# other columns.
# In addition, the target variable :code:`default payment next month` is
# changed to :code:`default` to reduce verbosity.

# From the `dataset description :footcite:`yeh2009comparisons`,
# we see there are three categorical features:
#
# - :code:`SEX`: Sex of the applicant (as a binary feature)
# - :code:`EDUCATION`: Highest level of education achieved by the applicant.
# - :code:`MARRIAGE`: Marital status of the applicant.

# %%
# Dataset imbalances
# ==================
#
# Before we start training a classifier model, we want to explore the
# dataset for any characteristics that may lead to fairness-related harms
# later on in the modeling process.
# In particular, we will focus on the distribution of sensitive feature
# :code:`SEX` and the target label :code:`default`.
#
# As part of an exploratory data analysis, let's explore the distribution of
# our sensitive feature :code:`SEX`. We see that 60% of loan applicants were
# labeled as `female` and 40% as `male`, so we do not need to worry about
# imbalance in this feature.

A_str.value_counts(normalize=True)

# %%
# Next, let's explore the distribution of the *loan default rate* :code:`Y`.
# We see that around 78% of individuals in the dataset do not default on their
# credit loan. While the target label does not display extreme imbalance, we
# will need to account for this imbalance in our modeling section. As opposed
# to the *sensitive feature* :code:`SEX`, an imbalance in the target label may
# result in a classifier that over-optimizes for the majority class.
# For example, a classifier that predicts an applicant will not default would
# achieve an accuracy of 78%, so we will use the :code:`balanced_accuracy`
# score as our evaluation metric to counteract the label imbalance.

Y.value_counts(normalize=True)

# %%
# Add synthetic noise that is related to the outcome and sex
# ==========================================================
#
# For the purpose of this case study, we add a synthetic feature
# :code:`Interest` that introduces correlation between the :code:`SEX` label
# of an applicant and the :code:`default` outcome.
# The purpose of this feature is to replicate outcome disparities present in
# the original dataset.
# We can think of this :code:`Interest` feature as the *interest rate* for
# the applicant.
# If the applicant has a history of defaulting on credit card payments, the
# bank will lend to the applicant at a higher interest rate.
# We also assume because banks have historically lended primarily to men,
# there is less uncertainty (or variance) in the *interest rate* for these
# applicants.
#
# To reflect the above reasoning, the :code:`Interest` feature is drawn from a
# *Gaussian distribution* with the following criterion:
#
# * If *Male*, draw :code:`Interest` from
#   :math:`\mathcal{N}(2 \cdot \text{Default}, 1)`
# * If *Female*, draw :code:`Interest` from
#   :math:`\mathcal{N}(2 \cdot \text{Default}, 2)`
#
# This feature is drawn from a *Gaussian distribution* for computational
# simplicity.

X.loc[:, "Interest"] = np.random.normal(loc=2 * Y, scale=A)

# %%
# Check if this will lead to disparity in naive model
# ===================================================
#
# Now that we have created our synthetic feature, let's check how this new
# feature interacts with our *sensitive_feature* :code:`Sex` and our target
# label :code:`default`.
# We see that for both sexes, the :code:`Interest` feature is higher for
# individuals who defaulted on their loan.

# Fairness assessment of unmitigated model
# ----------------------------------------
#
# Now that we have trained our initial fairness-unaware model, let's perform
# our fairness assessment for this model. When conducting a fairness assessment,
# there are three main steps we want to perform:
#
# 1. Identify who will be harmed.
# 2. Identify the types of harms we anticipate.
# 3. Define fairness metrics based on the anticipated harms.
#
# Who will be harmed?
# ===================
#
# Based on the incident with *Apple* credit card mentioned at the beginning
# of this notebook, we believe the model may incorrectly predict women will
# default on the credit loan. The system may unfairly allocate less loans to
# women and over-allocate loans to men.

# %%
# Types of harm experienced
# =========================
#
# When discussing fairness in AI systems, the first step is understanding
# what types of harms we anticipate the system may produce. Using the
# :ref:`harms taxonomy in the Fairlearn User Guide <types_of_harms>`,
# we expect this system to produce *harms of allocation*. In addition, we also
# anticipate the long-term impact on an individual's credit score if an
# individual is unable to repay a loan they receive or if they are rejected for
# a loan application. A *harm of allocation* occurs when an AI system extends or
# withholds resources, opportunities, information. In this scenario, the AI
# system is extending or withholding financial assets from individuals. A review
# of historical incidents shows these types of automated lending decision
# systems may discriminate unfairly based on sex.
#
# **Negative impact of credit score**
#
# A secondary harm that is somewhat unique to credit lending decisions is the
# long-term impact on an individual's credit score. In the United States, a
# `FICO credit score <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp>`_
# is a number between 300 and 850 that represents a customer's
# *creditworthiness*. An applicant's *credit score* is used by many financial
# institutions for lending decisions. An applicant's *credit score* usually
# increases after a successful repayment of a loan and decreases if the
# applicant fails to repay the loan.
#
# When applying for a credit loan, there are three major outcomes:
#
# 1. The individual receives the credit loan and pays back the loan. In this
#    scenario, we expect the individual's credit score to increase as a result
#    of the successful repayment of the loan.
#
# 2. The individual receives the credit loan but defaults on the loan. In this
#    scenario, the individual's credit score will drop drastically due to the
#    failure to repay the loan. In the modeling process, this outcome is tied to
#    a **false negative** (the model predicts the individual will repay the
#    loan, but the individual is unsuccessful in doing so).
#
# 3. In certain countries, such as the United States, an individual receives a
#    small drop (up to five points) to their credit score after a lender
#    performs a *hard inquiry* on the applicant's credit history. If the
#    applicant applies for a loan but does not receive it, the small decrease in
#    their credit score will impact their ability to successfully apply for a
#    future loan. In the modeling process, this outcome is tied to the
#    **selection rate** (the proportion of positive predictions outputted by the
#    model).
#
# **Prevention of wealth accumulation**
#
# One other type of harm we anticipate in this scenario is the long-term
# effects of *denying loans to applicants who would have successfully paid back
# the loan*. By receiving a loan, an applicant is able to purchase a home, start
# a business, or pursue some other economic activity that they are not able to
# do otherwise. These outcomes are tied to **false positive error** rates in
# which the model predicts an applicant will default on the loan, but the
# individual would have successfully paid the loan back. In the United States,
# the practice of redlining :footcite:`peyton2020redlining`, denying mortgage loans
# and other financial services to predominantly Black or other minority
# communities, has resulted in a vast racial wealth gap between white and Black
# Americans.
# Although the practice of redlining was banned in 1968 with the
# *Fair Housing Act*, the long-term impact of these practices
# :footcite:`jan2018redlining` is reflected in the lack of economic investment
# in Black communities, and Black applicants are denied loans at a higher rate
# compared to white Americans.
#
# Define fairness metrics based on harms
# --------------------------------------
#
# Now that we have identified the relevant harms we anticipate users will
# experience, we can define our fairness metrics. In addition to the metrics, we
# will quantify the uncertainty around each metric using *custom functions* to
# compute the *standard error* for each metric at the :math:`\alpha=0.95` confidence
# level.

#
# Mitigating Unfairness in ML models
# ----------------------------------
# In the previous section, we identified disparities in the model's
# performance with respect to :code:`SEX`. In particular, we found that model produces
# a significantly higher :code:`false_negative_rate` and :code:`false_positive_rate` for the
# applicants labeled :code:`female` compared to those labeled :code:`male`. In the context
# of credit decision scenario, this means the model under-allocates loans to
# *women* who would have paid the loan, but over-allocates loans to *women* who
# go on to default on their loan.
#
# In this section, we will discuss strategies for mitigating the performance
# disparities we found in our unmitigated model. We will apply two different
# mitigation strategies:
#
# - *Postprocessing*: In the postprocessing approach, the outputs of a trained
#   classifier are transformed to satisfy some fairness criterion.
# - *Reductions*: In the reductions approach, we take in a model class and
#   iteratively create a sequence of models that optimize some fairness
#   constraint. Compared to the *postprocessing* approach, the fairness
#   constraint is satisfied during the model training time rather than
#   afterwards.
#
# Postprocessing mitigations: ThresholdOptimizer
# ==============================================
# In the Fairlearn package, *postprocessing* mitigation is offered through
# the :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` algorithm, following
# :footcite:cts:`hardt2016equality`.
# The :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` takes in an existing (possibly pre-fit)
# machine learning model whose predictions acts as a scoring function to
# identify separate thresholds for each *sensitive feature* group.
# The :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` optimizes a specified objective metric
# (in our case, :code:`balanced_accuracy`) subject to some fairness constraint
# (`equalized_odds`), resulting in a thresholded version of the underlying
# machine learning model.
#
# To instantiate our :code:`ThresholdOptimizer`, we need to specify our fairness
# constraint as a model parameter. Because both :code:`false_negative_rate`
# disparities and :code:`false_positive_rate` disparities translate into real-world
# harms in our scenario, we will aim to minimize the :code:`equalized_odds` difference
# as our *fairness constraint*.

    prefit=True,

)

# %%
# One key limitation of the :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` is the need for sensitive
# features during training and prediction time. If we do not have access to the

#

# We see that the :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` algorithm achieves a much lower
# disparity between the two groups compared to the *unmitigated* model.
# However, this does come with the trade-off that the
# :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` achieves a lower :code:`balanced_accuracy` score
# for *male* applicants.
#
# Reductions approach to unfairness mitigation
# --------------------------------------------
# In the previous section, we took a fairness-unaware model and used the
# :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` to transform the model's decision boundary to
# satisfy our fairness constraints.
# One key limitation of the :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` is needing access to
# our *sensitive_feature* during prediction time.
#
# In this section, we will use the *reductions* approach of Agarwal et. al
# (2018) :footcite:`agarwal2018reductions` to produce models that satisfy
# the fairness constraint without needing access to the sensitive features at
# deployment time.
#
# The main reduction algorithm in Fairlearn is :code:`ExponentiatedGradient`.
# The algorithm creates a sequence of re-weighted datasets and retrains the
# wrapped classifier on each of the datasets.
# This re-training process is guaranteed to find a model that satisfies the
# fairness constraints while optimizing the performance metric.
#
# The model returned by :code:`ExponentiatedGradient` consists of several inner
# models, returned by a wrapped estimator.
#
# To instantiate an :code:`ExponentiatedGradient` model, we pass in two
# parameters:
#
# - a base :code:`estimator` (object that supports training)
# - fairness :code:`constraints` (object of type :class:`fairlearn.reductions.Moment`)
#
# When passing in a fairness *constraint* as a :code:`Moment`, we can specify
# an :code:`epsilon` value representing the maximum allowed difference or ratio
# between our largest and smallest value.
# For example, in the below code,
# :code:`EqualizedOdds(difference_bound=epsilon)` means that we are using
# :code:`EqualizedOdds` as our fairness constraint, and we will allow a
# maximal difference of :code:`epsilon` between our largest and smallest
# *equalized odds* value.

# Because the *performance-fairness trade-off* learned by the
# :code:`ExponentiatedGradient` model is sensitive to our chosen

# Here, we will train two :code:`ExponentiatedGradient` models, one with
# :code:`epsilon=0.01` and the second with :code:`epsilon=0.02`, and store the
# inner models learned through each of the training processes.
#
# In practice, we recommend choosing smaller values of :code:`epsilon` on

# For example, an :code:`epsilon=0.02` means that the training value of the
# *equalized odds difference* of the returned model is at most :code:`0.02`
# (if the algorithm converges).
#
# Reviewing inner models of ExponentiatedGradient
# ===============================================

# In addition, the multiple inner models of the algorithm introduce challenges
# for model interpretability.
# One potential workaround to avoid these issues is to select one of the inner
# models and deploy it instead.
#
# In the previous section, we trained multiple :code:`ExponentiatedGradient`
# models at different :code:`epsilon` levels and collected all the inner
# models learned by this process.
# When picking a suitable inner model, we consider trade-offs between
# our two metrics of interest: *balanced error rate* and *equalized odds difference*.
# Since our focus is on these two metrics, we will filter out

# Conclusion and Discussion
# ----------------------------
#
# In this case study, we walked through the process of assessing a credit
# decision model for gender-related performance disparities.
# Our analysis follows closely the work done in the Microsoft/EY white paper
# :footcite:`dudik2020assessing` where they used the *Fairlearn* toolkit to
# perform an audit of a fairness-unaware tree-based model.
# We applied a *postprocessing* and *reductions* mitigation techniques to
# mitigate the *equalized odds difference* in our model.
#
# Through the *reductions* process, we generated a model that reduces the
# *equalized odds difference* of the original model without a drastic increase
# in the *balanced error score*. If this were a real model being developed a
# financial institution, the *balanced error score* would be a proxy for the
# profitability of the model. By maintaining a relatively similar *balanced
# error score*, we've produced a model that preserves profitability to the firm
# while producing more fair and equitable outcomes for women in this scenario.
#
# Designing a Model Card
# ======================
#
# A key facet of Responsible Machine Learning is responsible documentation
# practices. :footcite:ct:`mitchell2019model`
# proposed the model card framework for documentating and reporting model
# training details and deployment considerations.
#
# A *model card* contains sections for documenting training and evaluation
# dataset descriptions, ethical concerns, and quantitative evaluation summaries.
# In practice, we would ideally create a model card for our model before
# deploying it in production. Although we will not be producing a model card in
# this case study, interested readers can learn more about creating model cards
# using the *Model Card Toolkit* from the
# `Fairlearn PyCon tutorial <https://github.com/fairlearn/talks/tree/main/2022_pycon>`_.
#
# Fairness under unawareness
# ==========================
#
# When proving credit models are compliant with fair lending laws,
# practitoners may run into the issue of not having access to the sensitive
# demographic features. As a result, financial institutions are often tasked
# with proving their models are compliant with fair lending laws by imputing
# these demographics features. However, :footcite:ct:`chen2019fairness` show
# these imputation methods often introduce new fairness-related issues.
