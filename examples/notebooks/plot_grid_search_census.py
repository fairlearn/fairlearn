GridSearch with Census Data
===========================
"""
# %%
# This notebook shows how to use Fairlearn and the Fairness dashboard to generate predictors
# for the Census dataset.
# This dataset is a classification problem - given a range of data about 32,000 individuals,
# predict whether their annual income is above or below fifty thousand dollars per year.
#
# For the purposes of this notebook, we shall treat this as a loan decision problem.
# We will pretend that the label indicates whether or not each individual repaid a loan in
# the past.
# We will use the data to train a predictor to predict whether previously unseen individuals
# will repay a loan or not.
# The assumption is that the model predictions are used to decide whether an individual
# should be offered a loan.
#
# We will first train a fairness-unaware predictor and show that it leads to unfair
# decisions under a specific notion of fairness called *demographic parity*.
# We then mitigate unfairness by applying the :code:`GridSearch` algorithm from the
# Fairlearn package.

# %%
# Load and preprocess the data set
# --------------------------------
# We download the data set using `fetch_adult` function in `fairlearn.datasets`.
# We start by importing the various modules we're going to use:

from fairlearn.widget import FairlearnDashboard
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from fairlearn.reductions import GridSearch
from fairlearn.reductions import DemographicParity, ErrorRate
from fairlearn.datasets import fetch_adult

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import pandas as pd

# %%
# We can now load and inspect the data by using the `fairlearn.datasets` module:

data = fetch_adult(as_frame=True)
X_raw = data.data
Y = (data.target == '>50K') * 1
X_raw

# %%
# We are going to treat the sex of each individual as a sensitive
# feature (where 0 indicates female and 1 indicates male), and in
# this particular case we are going separate this feature out and drop it
# from the main data.
# We then perform some standard data preprocessing steps to convert the
# data into a format suitable for the ML algorithms

A = X_raw["sex"]
X = X_raw.drop(labels=['sex'], axis=1)
X = pd.get_dummies(X)

sc = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = sc.fit_transform(X)
X_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_scaled, columns=X.columns)

le = LabelEncoder()
Y = le.fit_transform(Y)

# %%
# Finally, we split the data into training and test sets:

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test, A_train, A_test = train_test_split(X_scaled,
                                                                     Y,
                                                                     A,
                                                                     test_size=0.2,
                                                                     random_state=0,
                                                                     stratify=Y)

# Work around indexing bug
X_train = X_train.reset_index(drop=True)
A_train = A_train.reset_index(drop=True)
X_test = X_test.reset_index(drop=True)
A_test = A_test.reset_index(drop=True)

# %%
# Training a fairness-unaware predictor
# -------------------------------------
#
# To show the effect of Fairlearn we will first train a standard ML predictor
# that does not incorporate fairness.
# For speed of demonstration, we use the simple
# :class:`sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` class:

unmitigated_predictor = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', fit_intercept=True)

unmitigated_predictor.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# %%
# We can load this predictor into the Fairness dashboard, and assess its fairness:

FairlearnDashboard(sensitive_features=A_test, sensitive_feature_names=['sex'],
                   y_true=Y_test,
                   y_pred={"unmitigated": unmitigated_predictor.predict(X_test)})

# %%
# Looking at the disparity in accuracy, we see that males have an error
# about three times greater than the females.
# More interesting is the disparity in opportunity - males are offered loans at
# three times the rate of females.
#
# Despite the fact that we removed the feature from the training data, our
# predictor still discriminates based on sex.
# This demonstrates that simply ignoring a sensitive feature when fitting a
# predictor rarely eliminates unfairness.
# There will generally be enough other features correlated with the removed
# feature to lead to disparate impact.

# %%
# Mitigation with GridSearch
# --------------------------
#
# The :class:`fairlearn.reductions.GridSearch` class implements a simplified version of the
# exponentiated gradient reduction of `Agarwal et al. 2018 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02453>`_.
# The user supplies a standard ML estimator, which is treated as a blackbox.
# `GridSearch` works by generating a sequence of relabellings and reweightings, and
# trains a predictor for each.
#
# For this example, we specify demographic parity (on the sensitive feature of sex) as
# the fairness metric.
# Demographic parity requires that individuals are offered the opportunity (are approved
# for a loan in this example) independent of membership in the sensitive class (i.e., females
# and males should be offered loans at the same rate).
# We are using this metric for the sake of simplicity; in general, the appropriate fairness
# metric will not be obvious.

sweep = GridSearch(LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', fit_intercept=True),
                   constraints=DemographicParity(),
                   grid_size=71)

# %%
# Our algorithms provide :code:`fit()` and :code:`predict()` methods, so they behave in a similar manner
# to other ML packages in Python.
# We do however have to specify two extra arguments to :code:`fit()` - the column of sensitive
# feature labels, and also the number of predictors to generate in our sweep.
#
# After :code:`fit()` completes, we extract the full set of predictors from the
# :class:`fairlearn.reductions.GridSearch` object.

sweep.fit(X_train, Y_train,
          sensitive_features=A_train)

predictors = sweep.predictors_

# %%
# We could load these predictors into the Fairness dashboard now.
# However, the plot would be somewhat confusing due to their number.
# In this case, we are going to remove the predictors which are dominated in the
# error-disparity space by others from the sweep (note that the disparity will only be
# calculated for the sensitive feature; other potentially sensitive features will
# not be mitigated).
# In general, one might not want to do this, since there may be other considerations
# beyond the strict optimization of error and disparity (of the given sensitive feature).

errors, disparities = [], []
for m in predictors:
    def classifier(X): return m.predict(X)

    error = ErrorRate()
    error.load_data(X_train, pd.Series(Y_train), sensitive_features=A_train)
    disparity = DemographicParity()
    disparity.load_data(X_train, pd.Series(Y_train), sensitive_features=A_train)

    errors.append(error.gamma(classifier)[0])
    disparities.append(disparity.gamma(classifier).max())

all_results = pd.DataFrame({"predictor": predictors, "error": errors, "disparity": disparities})

non_dominated = []
for row in all_results.itertuples():
    errors_for_lower_or_eq_disparity = all_results["error"][all_results["disparity"] <= row.disparity]
    if row.error <= errors_for_lower_or_eq_disparity.min():

# %%
# Finally, we can put the dominant models into the Fairness dashboard, along with the
# unmitigated model.

dashboard_predicted = {"unmitigated": unmitigated_predictor.predict(X_test)}

    key = "dominant_model_{0}".format(i)

FairlearnDashboard(sensitive_features=A_test, sensitive_feature_names=['sex'],
                   y_true=Y_test,
                   y_pred=dashboard_predicted)

# %%
# We see a Pareto front forming - the set of predictors which represent optimal tradeoffs
# between accuracy and disparity in predictions.
# In the ideal case, we would have a predictor at (1,0) - perfectly accurate and without
# any unfairness under demographic parity (with respect to the sensitive feature "sex").
# The Pareto front represents the closest we can come to this ideal based on our data and
# choice of estimator.
# Note the range of the axes - the disparity axis covers more values than the accuracy,
# so we can reduce disparity substantially for a small loss in accuracy.
#
# By clicking on individual models on the plot, we can inspect their metrics for disparity
# and accuracy in greater detail.
# In a real example, we would then pick the model which represented the best trade-off
# between accuracy and disparity given the relevant business constraints.
