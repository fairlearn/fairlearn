# Similarly, :class:`fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient` works with
# pipelines. Since it requires the :code:`sample_weight` parameter of the
# underlying estimator internally we need to provide it with the correct
# way of passing :code:`sample_weight` to just the :code:`"classifier"` step
# using the step name followed by two underscores and :code:`sample_weight`.
